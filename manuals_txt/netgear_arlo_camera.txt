How Arlo Works
Your camera works wire-free, powered by the battery. When your Arlo camera 
detects motion, it uses a WiFi link to the Arlo base station to stream video to your 
Arlo account in the cloud. 
The appearance of the Arlo base station varies, as shown in the following 
illustrations.

Firmware Updates
A firmware update might start after you sync a camera to the base station. If a 
firmware update is in progress, the LED on the camera blinks alternating blue and 
amber. After this, the LED is off for one to two minutes while the camera installs 
the firmware. This update happens automatically.
Important: Do not open the battery door while an Arlo camera is updating and 
installing firmware.
After the camera firmware update completes, the camera syncs to the base 
station again and the LED blinks blue rapidly.

12 Set Up Your System 
Place or Mount Your Cameras
You can place your camera on a shelf or other 
flat surface, or you can mount it on the wall.
Note:  Use the Arlo app in Position mode to help aim 
the camera. See Position Mode on page 16. 
Â¾  To mount your camera on the wall:
1.  Fasten the mounting screw into the 
wall,  and hang the magnetic mount from the 
screw.  
2.  If youâre mounting the camera on drywall, be 
sure to use the plastic drywall anchors that 
are provided.
Note:  You can also use double-sided tape instead 
of screws.
Choose a Good Spot for Your Camera
Place your Arlo camera in a location with a clear, unblocked field of view and with a 
good WiFi signal to the base station.
Itâs important to keep distance in mind when placing your Arlo cameras:
â¢  Maximum. Place your camera a maximum of 300 feet (90 meters) from the base 
station. The maximum line-of-sight range of 300 feet is reduced by each wall, 
ceiling, or other major obstruction between the camera and base station. The 
following materials reduce signal strength the most:
â¢  Unusually thick walls and ceilings
â¢  Brick
â¢  Concrete
â¢  Stone
â¢  Ceramic
â¢  Glass, especially mirrors
â¢  Metal
â¢  Large quantities of water, such as the water in a fish tank or water heater
13 Set Up Your System 
Note:  Check the Camera LED on the base station. If itâs blinking amber, the base station 
detects a low data rate, a sign that a camera is too far from the base station.
â¢  Minimum. Place your Arlo cameras at 10 feet (300 centimeters) away from the 
base station, and allow at least 6Â½ feet (2 meters) between cameras. Follow 
these guidelines to prevent WiFi signals between the devices from interfering 
with each other.
Position Your Camera to Optimize Its Field of View
Your Arlo camera has a 110-degree field of view. In the following images, the green 
areas show your cameraâs field of view, both horizontally and vertically.
When positioning your Arlo camera, keep these tips in mind: 
â¢  Keep active locations in the cameraâs field of view. Your Arlo camera 
provides a 110-degree viewing angle. Position your camera so that the space 
that you want to monitor is within the cameraâs field of view. 
14 Set Up Your System 
â¢  Aim with the cloud. Use Arloâs Position mode to send video to the cloud as 
quickly as possible. This allows you to aim the camera while watching the video 
feed on your Arlo smartphone app to make near-real-time adjustments to the 
cameraâs position. Go to your cameraâs Settings page to turn on Position mode. 
After the camera is in place, you can turn off Position mode, or wait for it to 
automatically turn off after five minutes. For more information, see Position 
Mode on page 16.
â¢  Elevate your camera. Mount your Arlo motion detection camera at least 7 
feet (2 meters) above the floor or the ground and aim it slightly downward for 
the best sensor performance.
â¢  Make sure that side-to-side traffic crosses Arloâs field of view. Arloâs 
motion sensor is much more sensitive to side-to-side movement across its field 
of view than to movement directly toward or away from the camera. The best 
area for motion detection is 5 to 20 feet (1.5 to 6 meters) from the camera 
position. 
You can use the Motion Detection Test to verify if motion can be detected in 
a cameraâs current placement. The cameraâs LED blinks amber when motion is 
detected. Go to your cameraâs Settings page to turn on the Motion Detection 
Test.
15 Set Up Your System 
Position Mode
Position mode is available only when the camera is not streaming, recording motion, 
or in a motion detection mode.
Â¾  To place your camera in Position mode:
1.  Tap the Arlo icon   on your mobile device.
If you are using a computer, enter arlo.netgear.com in the address bar of a 
browser.
If you are using a mobile device that supports a Touch ID fingerprint identity 
sensor, you are prompted to enable Touch ID or skip.
2.  Tap the gear icon for the camera feed on your mobile device.
The Settings page displays.
3.  Tap or click Position Mode. 
Note:  If Position Mode is grayed out and you cannot tap it, the camera might be in 
Armed mode or another motion detection mode. To stop motion detection, tap Mode, 
and then select Disarmed for the camera.
The camera starts streaming video. 
In Position mode, the camera streams video as fast as possible, without 
buffering, so that you can aim the camera while watching on a smartphone and 
make near-real-time adjustments. This means that you might see lower-quality 
video while the camera is in Position mode.
4.  Adjust the camera position as needed.
5.  If you selected the Disarmed mode for the camera and now you want the 
camera to detect motion again, tap Mode and select the desired mode.

decrease the range. For best results, make sure that your cameras show three 
or four bars of signal strength in the area where you intend to install them. 
When signal strength is at one or two bars, cameras might go out of range 
intermittently due to fluctuations in the environment, and video quality suffers.
2.  Minimize the number of networks, WiFi devices, and transmitted frequencies 
near your base station and cameras. 
To prevent signal interference, place your cameras at least 10 feet (3 meters) 
from the base station, and allow at least 6Â½ feet (2 meters) between 
cameras. Do not place your base station or cameras near cordless telephones, 
microwaves, or WiFi-enabled devices. 
3.  Change the Power Management setting to Best Video. 
For more information about video settings, see Video Settings on page 46.
26 View Your Content 
Note:  If bandwidth is limited on your WiFi network, selecting Best Video does not 
necessarily improve video quality. Selecting Best Video also reduces battery life for 
wire-free cameras. 
4.  Make sure that your Internet connection has an upload speed of at least 
1 Mbps.
To test your upload speed, visit this Google search link on a computer that is 
connected to your WiFi network and select RUN SPEED TEST: 
https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=upload+speed+test. 
Even if your upload speed is at least 1 Mpbs, simultaneous uploads might 
degrade the quality of your Arlo video stream. To improve your connection, avoid 
uploading other data while you are streaming video. This includes uploading 
torrent files as well as uploading videos or pictures to remote web sites such as 
Flickr or YouTube or remote backup sites and cloud drives such as Dropbox or 
iCloud. 
5.  If your router supports Quality of Service (QoS) or traffic shaping, make sure 
that your router settings are optimized for streaming video.

32 4.  Modes, Rules, and Smart Alerts
Modes and rules let you tell your Arlo system what to do in different situations. For 
example, you can set your Arlo system to record a 30-second video when the motion 
sensor is activated on a specific camera and alert you by email.
Modes
Modes let you tell your Arlo cameras to respond differently at different times. 
For example, you probably donât want to receive an alert about motion in the 
living room while youâre doing yoga in the living room. You might want to turn on 
a different mode when youâre away on vacation than when youâre just out at the 
store for an hour. Arlo modes give you complete control over how your cameras 
respond to motion or sound.
You can create your own modes, but Arlo Wire-Free comes with the following 
modes:
 Armed. Detection is on for this camera. 
 Disarmed. Detection is off for this camera.
 Schedule. Manage detection based on a schedule.
 Geofencing. You can use geofencing to arm, disarm, or resume a schedule  
        mode when you arrive at or leave a given location based on your mobile  
        device.
You can customize the Armed and Schedule modes and you can add new modes. 
You might want to create a mode in which some motion sensors and cameras are 
active but others are not. For example, when you are sleeping, you might want your 
exterior cameras to be active, but your interior cameras to be inactive.
Note:  You can create different modes for the same camera, but the camera can use only 
one mode at a time.
33 Modes, Rules, and Smart Alerts 
Rules
Each mode consists of one or more rules that provide detailed instructions for 
your Arlo system. For each mode, you can set the following options:
â¢  Trigger device. The trigger device is the camera that detects motion.
â¢  Trigger. Triggers can be motion detection on Arlo cameras. You can adjust the 
cameraâs sensitivity to motion to minimize false alarms. 
â¢  Devices. Motion detection on one camera can trigger another camera to 
record video or take a snapshot. For example, you might want your back yard 
camera or your driveway camera to trigger your door camera to start recording 
video.
â¢  Action. Each device that responds to motion can record video, take a snapshot, 
or do nothing. You can adjust the length of the video recording from a minimum 
of 10 seconds to a maximum of two minutes. 
â¢  Notifications. When a trigger is detected, Arlo can send you push notifications, 
email alerts, or both. You can also choose to send email alerts to friends, family 
members, pet sitters, or anyone who might need to respond when a camera is 
triggered.
The Arlo mobile and web apps guide you through the process of setting up your 
Arlo system and telling it what you want it to do, but the Arlo knowledge base also 
offers detailed instructions to help you get the most out of your Arlo Smart Home 
Security System. 
Select a Mode
You can turn modes on and off manually or set modes to activate according to a 
schedule. Use the following method when you are not using a schedule to control a 
mode or when you want to override an existing schedule. You must use at least one

Make sure that these conditions are met:
â¢  Your Arlo devices are online.
â¢  Your geofencing feature is enabled.
â¢  Your friendâs mobile device is added to your account.
For more information about adding devices, see Enable or Disable Geofencing 
for Friendsâ Mobile Devices.
â¢  (Required when your friend wants to participate in geofencing) Your friend is 
logged in to the Arlo App on a mobile device.
â¢  (Required when your friend wants to participate in geofencing) The GPS or

For more information, see Set Up Geofencing on page 37.
Geofencing Accuracy
For accuracy, geofencing uses a combination of GPS, cellular data, and WiFi data.
â¢  In urban environments, where the cell towers and WiFi routers are more dense, 
geofencing accuracy can reach 100â200 meters.
Note: If you live in a skyscraper, geofencing might not work reliably due to GPS 
inaccuracies. Using the Large radius setting might help.
â¢  In more rural areas, where cell towers and WiFi routers are sparse, geofencing 
accuracy can reach several hundred meters.
To improve geofencing accuracy, maker sure that your mobile device meets these 
conditions:
â¢  WiFi is turned on.
â¢  GPS or location services are turned on.
Geofencing First In, Last Out
Arlo cameras use the first in, last out principal within the geofencing feature. 
First in, last out allows you to come and go without worrying about arming and 
disarming your Arlo cameras. For example, if your roommate leaves the house 
before you, your Arlo cameras remain disarmed because you are still in the house 
or geofence. After you leave the house and both devices are outside the geofence, 
your Arlo cameras are armed.
For more information about managing multiple devices, see Geofencing With 
Multipe Mobile Devices on page 39.

56 9.  FAQs and Troubleshooting
Battery FAQs
What do the battery bars indicate?
The battery bars indicate battery capacity:
â¢  3 bars. 61â100 percent
â¢  2 bars. 17â60 percent
â¢  1 bar. 1â16 percent
â¢  0 bars. 0% percent
What do I need to know about using Arlo cameras in cold weather?
Cold temperatures can affect any batteryâs capacity, due to the chemistry 
of batteries. This means that if you install your Arlo camera outside in cold 
temperatures, you might notice a shorter battery life for the camera, or a faster 
than expected drop in the displayed battery capacity.  
Why does one Arlo camera battery drain faster than another Arlo camera 
battery?
Your Arlo camera is flexible and you can use it in a wide range of environments. 
Your environment might include elements that affect battery life. Some of the 
places that you might place your Arlo camera use more battery power than others. 
Note the following examples:
Arlo cameras work well in the dark. They use infrared sensors to monitor motion in 
the dark. These use more battery power than cameras monitoring motion in a well-
lit room.
Arlo cameras work well when they are as far away as 300 feet from the base 
station. Cameras positioned farther away from the base station use more battery 
power than cameras positioned close to the base station.
Arlo cameras let you choose the quality level of the videos that they record. 
Cameras set to high-quality video recording use more battery power than cameras 
set to low-quality video recording.
Will my WiFi environment affect my Arlo camera battery?
Yes. If you are in a noisy WiFi environment, your Arlo camera battery might drain 
faster. Use a WiFi analyzer to test the WiFi noise in your environment.
57 FAQs and Troubleshooting 
What is the battery life for NETGEAR Arlo cameras?
The NETGEAR Arlo camera battery life is four to six months with normal usage and 
can be extended for optimal usage if you use key settings and follow certain tips. 
The cameras offer the best battery life when set up to record when they detect 
motion. 
How can I extend the NETGEAR Arlo cameraâs battery life?
To extend your NETGEAR Arlo cameraâs battery life, follow these tips: 
â¢  Be sure that you are running the latest version of firmware on your Arlo base 
station. For more information about updating your firmware, visit What do I 
need to know about Arlo camera firmware updates?
â¢  Check your NETGEAR Arlo cameraâs power management settings. To extend 
your battery life, select the Best Battery Life setting. This setting trades 
video quality for improved battery life. For best video quality, select the Best 
Video setting. This setting reduces battery life but provides the highest quality 
images. To balance the battery life and video quality, select the Optimized 
setting. To access your power management settings, log in to your Arlo account, 
select Settings > Camera Settings, and select a camera. 
â¢  Normal usage is defined as four minutes of viewing or recording per day with 
the Arlo camera in the Optimized setting. 
â¢  Depending on your specific usage, you might see different results. Also note 
that a NETGEAR Arlo cameraâs distance from the base station can affect its 
battery life.
Manage Bandwidth for Streaming
The bandwidth used by cameras depends on the camera settings as follows:
â¢  Best Video. 700â750 kilobits per second (kbps)
â¢  Optimized. 450â550 kbps
â¢  Best Battery Life. 300 kbps
For information about setting the resolution for your camera, see Video Settings 
on page 45 .
Reduce the Number of Notifications
Arlo sends notifications according to the rules in the mode that is currently active. 
To reduce unwanted notifications, you might need to adjust the position of one 
or more cameras, reduce motion sensitivity, change your notification settings, or 
create a custom mode.  
58 FAQs and Troubleshooting 
Â¾  To reduce the number of unwanted notifications that you receive:
1.  Position your camera so that it does not pick up the motion that is triggering 
the camera to notify you. 
For example, if Arlo is notifying you about cars passing in the street, aim your 
camera so that the street is outside the cameraâs field of view.  For more 
information about camera positioning, see How Arlo Works on page 6.
2.  If you are unable to position your camera so that the field of view includes only  
motion that you care about, reduce your cameraâs motion sensitivity instead. 
You must reduce your cameraâs motion sensitivity in the rules for each mode in 
which you receive unwanted notifications. For more information about finding 
the right motion sensitivity setting, see Change Motion Sensitivity on page 35. 
3.  If you like the number of videos that Arlo is recording, but you want to receive 
fewer notifications, either edit the notification settings in your modes and 
rules or create a different custom mode for when you want recordings without 
notifications. 
For example, you can create a mode that records but does not send 
notifications so that you can watch pet videos in your Arlo library without 
getting notified every time your pet moves or makes noise. 
Canât See Video Streams in a Browser
Â¾  To troubleshoot problems with the video stream:
1.  If you canât see your video streams from a web browser, but you can see them 
on your mobile device, make sure that your browser isnât blocking the plug-in 
and that you are using the latest version of Adobe Flash. 
For help with Adobe Flash Player, visit https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html.
2.  Make sure that ports 443 and 80 are open on your router. 
Arlo uses these ports for streaming. Some antivirus applications, particularly 
those with firewalls, block these ports, so temporarily disabling your antivirus 
or moving Arlo to the firewallâs DMZ might help. For more information about 
opening ports, see your routerâs documentation. For more information about 
your antivirus application, see your antivirus documentation.
3.  Minimize the number of networks, WiFi devices, and transmitted frequencies 
near your base station and cameras. 
59 Place your cameras at least 10 feet (3 meters) from the base station, and allow 
at least 6Â½ feet (2 meters) between cameras. Avoid placing your base station 
or cameras near cordless phones, microwaves, or WiFi-enabled devices. Follow 
these guidelines to prevent signal interference between your Arlo devices and 
other WiFi devices.
4.  Make sure that your Wire-Free camera is no farther than 300 feet (90 meters) 
from the base station. 
The 300-foot line-of-sight range is reduced by each metal object, thick wall, 
or other obstruction between a camera and the base station. For best results, 
make sure that your cameras show three or four bars of signal strength in 
the area where you intend to install them. The cameras can work when signal 
strength is at one or two bars, but they might go out of range intermittently 
due to fluctuations in the environment, and the batteries deplete faster when 
cameras are trying to reconnect.
5.  Change or recharge the batteries on any cameras that are operating on 
battery power to make sure that the battery level is no less than two bars. 
A low battery can cause the camera to stream intermittently.
Not Receiving Push Notifications
You must be logged in to the Arlo app to receive Arlo alerts on your smartphone or 
mobile device.  Arlo registers your device for push notification when you log in. If 
you used the logout option instead of simply exiting the app, you must log back in 
to the app. You receive Arlo alerts even if your device is sleeping.
Make sure that other applications on your mobile device, such as Shutapp or Doze, 
are not suppressing push notifications. Make sure that your mobile device is not in 
Do Not Disturb mode.

the device back on. After you reinstall the app, return the system clock to the 
correct setting.
Verify That the Arlo Base Station Is Online
To determine whether your base station is online, check the Internet LED on the 
front of the base station:
â¢  If the Internet LED is solid green, the base station is connected to the Internet.
â¢  If the Internet LED is amber, the base station is not connected to the Internet.
If you are not at the same location as your Arlo base station, log in to your Arlo 
account and check the following:
â¢  If you can review the video feed from each of your Arlo cameras, your base 
station is connected to the Internet.
â¢  If you see an error message (such as âBase Station Offlineâ or something similar) 
instead of video feed, your base station is not connected to the Internet.
62 FAQs and Troubleshooting 
Base Station Is Offline
If you are not sure whether the base station is offline, see Verify That the Arlo 
Base Station Is Online on page 62.
Â¾  To troubleshoot the base station Internet connection: 
1.  Check the Ethernet cable.
Make sure that itâs securely connected to the back of your base station and 
to your router. Also make sure that youâre using the Ethernet cable that came 
with your system.
2.  Check the power adapter.
Make sure that the power adapter is securely connected to the back of your 
base station and securely plugged into an outlet.
3.  Try to connect to the Internet from another device that is connected directly 
to your router.
Be sure to try an Ethernet-connected device, not a device that is connected 
using WiFi (you can turn WiFi off on the device to make sure that the device is 
connecting through the Ethernet cable). Make sure that you can browse the 
Internet from this device by doing the following:
â¢  If you cannot browse the Internet from this device, you must restore your 
routerâs connection to the Internet.
â¢  If you can browse the Internet from this device, continue troubleshooting.
4.  Power cycle your base station.
Unplug the power adapter from the outlet, wait one minute, and reconnect 
the power adapter to the outlet. The base station takes one to two minutes 
to start. When the Power LED and Internet LED light solid green, your base 
station is connected to the Internet. If the Internet LED is amber, continue 
troubleshooting.
5.  Check your routerâs DHCP settings and client list.
Make sure that DHCP is enabled and that the routerâs DCHP client list supplied 
an IP address to the base station. (If it did, the base station appears in the client 
list.) For more information, see your router documentation. 
6.  If you were previously able to connect your base station to the Internet but 
now cannot connect, check the routerâs security settings and firmware to make 
63 FAQs and Troubleshooting 
sure that no changes were made since the last time it successfully connected.
You might want to temporarily lower the security settings on the router 
or temporarily place the base station in the DMZ to rule out any firewall 
restrictions. If you make these changes, power cycle your base station as 
described in Step 4.
7.  Check to make sure that ports 443 and 80 are open on your router.
Note: If you do not manage your Internet environment, contact your IT 
department for assistance with any firewall or router configurations. The Arlo 
base station cannot connect through most proxy servers. Check with your 
IT team and Internet service provider (ISP) about ways to bypass any proxy 
servers. Ask your IT team to make sure that ports 443 and 80 are open.
8.  Perform a factory reset on your base station. 
For more information, see Reset the Arlo Base Station to Factory Settings on 
page 65.
If you are still unable to get your base station to connect, visit support.arlo.com 
and submit a support case describing the steps you took and provide the following 
information:
â¢  Base station serial number
â¢  User name (email address used to register Arlo account)
â¢  Internet service provider (ISP) name
â¢  Internet connection type (DSL, cable, and so on) and speed (Arlo requires at 
least 1 Mbps upstream)
â¢  Internet router model
â¢  List of other devices connected directly to your router
â¢  The last time and place that your base station successfully connected to the 
Internet
Signal Strength
If an Arlo cameraâs signal to the base station is weak, recording delays might occur 
when motion is detected. 
To test whether the camera signal is strong enough, check the Camera LED on the 
base station. If itâs blinking amber, the base station detects a low data rate, which 
means that a camera is too far from the base station.
64 Follow these tips to increase signal strength:
â¢  Position your base station so that it is central to all of your cameras. 
â¢  Position your camera a maximum of 300 feet (90 meters) from the base station.
The maximum line-of-sight range of 300 feet is reduced by each wall, ceiling, or 
other large obstruction between the camera and base station. The following 
materials reduce signal strength the most:
â¢  Unusually thick walls and ceilings
â¢  Brick
â¢  Concrete
â¢  Stone
â¢  Ceramic
â¢  Glass, especially mirrors
â¢  Metal
â¢  Large quantities of water, such as the water in a fish tank or water heater
â¢  Mount your cameras away from devices such as cordless phone bases, baby 
monitors, and microwave ovens. 
â¢  Do not place your Arlo system near multiple WiFi routers. Other WiFi-enabled 
devices can interfere with Arloâs wireless signal.
Reset the Arlo Base Station to Factory Settings
Performing a factory reset returns your base station values to the default 
settings. It also removes the serial number from your Arlo account.
Â¾  To perform a factory reset on your base station:
1.  Use a pen or a straightened paper clip to press and hold the Reset button on 
the back of the base station for about 10 seconds.
When the base station reset completes, the LEDs on the front of the base 
station blink amber. When the LEDs stop blinking amber, your base station 
reboots. The base station is removed from your Arlo account.
2.  When the Power and Internet LEDs both light solid green, tap the Arlo icon on 
your mobile device and log in to your Arlo account. 
If you are using a computer, enter netgear.com in the address bar of a browser.
3.  Tap or click New to Arlo?.
