PLACEMENT GUIDELINES 
To avoid risk of overheating and burns:
Use only in temperatures between –4° and 
104°F (–20° to 40°C). 
Keep out of direct sunlight.
Do not block airflow to Nest Cam.
To avoid risk of fire and shock:
Use only the provided USB cable and power adapter.
Install in accordance with building and installation 
codes where you live. For example, if your desired 
electrical outlet is exposed to direct rain, the 
electrical code may require that the outlet have 
a while-in-use cover.
We recommend using only an electrical outlet equipped 
with a ground fault circuit interrupter (look for “Test” 
and “Reset” buttons on your outlet).
To avoid risk of other serious injury:
Keep camera and all components out of the reach 
of children and pets.
If your Nest Cam is installed more than 6.5 feet (2 m) 
above the ground, make sure you’ve got a cable clip 
close to the camera head (19.5 inches or 50 cm from 
the base).
