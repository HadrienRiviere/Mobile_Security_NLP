RECOMMENDED INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
This device should only be installed in light fittings and fixtures that are designed  
to accept each fitting. Lamps, fittings and fixtures that are designed to accept 
smaller or lower wattage light bulbs may result in the LIFX® bulb operating below 
its optimal capacity. For optimal performance it is recommended that LIFX® bulbs 
be fitted into fixtures that provide sufficient air flow through and around the bulb.  
It is recommended that the LIFX® bulb be installed away from other devices 
designed to receive or transmit radio signals. It is recommended LIFX® bulb/s  
be installed and operated at a minimum distance of 30 cm from the body.  
For lamps with a weight significantly higher than that of lamps for which they are  
a replacement, attention should be drawn to the fact that the increased weight  
may reduce the mechanical stability of certain luminaires and may impair contact  
making and lamp retention. INTERFERENCE
LIFX® has been designed to minimise interference with other radio, broadcast 
or receiving devices. The manufacturer is not responsible for any interference 
caused as a result of modifications to the product or by failure to adhere to the 
recommendations in this document and at support.lifx.com. This device generates 
radio frequency energy and, if not installed in accordance with the “recommended 
installation requirements” may cause harmful interference to radio communication 
devices. If the device is causing radio interference it is recommended that the 
user try: 
a)  relocating the device to a different place;
b)  adjust the antenna on the receiving device;
c)    consult a technician experienced in radio interference.
