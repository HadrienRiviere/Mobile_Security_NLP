Important information 
 
The lightning flash with arrowhead symbol, within an equilateral triangle is intended to alert the user to the 
presence of uninsulated dangerous voltage within the product's enclosure that may be of sufficient 
magnitude to constitute a risk of electric shock. 
The exclamation point within an equilateral triangle is intended to alert the user to the presence of important 
operating and maintenance (servicing) instructions in the literature accompanying the product. 
 
This symbol indicates that this product incorporates double insulation between hazardous main voltage and 
user accessible parts. When servicing, use only identical replacement parts. 
WARNING: To reduce the risk of fire or electric shock, do not expose this product to rain or moisture. This product 
should not be exposed to dripping or splashing. No objects filled with liquids, such as vases, should be placed on or 
near the product. 
WARNING: The TV is unstable if it is not properly attached to the base or mounted to the wall. Be sure to follow the 
base or wall mounting instructions provided in the User’s Guide to ensure your safety. 
WARNING: Do not expose batteries to excessive heat such as sunshine, fire, and so forth. 
WARNING: This product may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or 
other reproductive harm. For more information, go to www.p65warnings.ca.gov. 
Proper operating voltage 
Refer to the identification/rating label located on the back panel of your product for its proper operating voltage. 
Cable TV installer notice of proper grounding 
This reminder is provided to call your attention to Article 820-40 of the National Electrical Code (Section 54 of the 
Canadian Electrical Code, Part 1) which provides guidelines for proper grounding and, in particular, specifies that the 
cable ground should be connected to the grounding system of the building as close to the point of cable entry as 
practical. 
Installation location 
Important: This television is a table model and is designed to sit on a firm, flat surface. Don’t place the TV on soft 
carpeting or similar surface because the ventilation slots on the bottom of the unit will be blocked, resulting in 
reduced lifetime from overheating. To assure adequate ventilation for this product, maintain a spacing of 4 inches 
from the top and side of the TV receiver and 2 inches from the rear of the TV receiver and other surfaces.  
Also, make sure the stand or base you use is of adequate size and strength to prevent the TV from being accidentally 
tipped over, pushed off, or pulled off the stand. This could cause personal injury and/or damage to the TV. Refer to 
the Important Safety Instructions on the following pages. 
Low power standby mode 
The Power button (indicated by the power symbol) on this TV and its remote control puts the TV into a very low 
power standby mode but does not completely turn the power off. To completely shut the power off, you must 
disconnect the power cord from the power outlet. The mains plug/appliance coupler is used as a disconnect device. 
Therefore, you should be sure that the TV is installed in a manner to enable the power cord to be disconnected when 
necessary.  
Note:	In	situations	where	the	power	plug	or	appliance	coupler	is	used	as	the	disconnect	device,	the	disconnect	device	shall	remain	readily	
accessible	and	operable.

watching the program after it is already in progress, or you see something 
you missed in the Smart Guide, you can use More Ways to Watch to find 
streaming channels where you can see the show from the beginning, find 
other episodes, or entire seasons of the show, if applicable. 
4.  Use Roku’s Smart TV experience to discover More Ways to Watch on other inputs

Antenna TV input, and only when the TV is linked to a valid Roku account. 
8.  Control your TV with voice commands

any terms, enter codes, or provide required information before you can get 
Internet access.

Connections and setup 
Before initial setup 
Protect against power surges 
•  Connect all components before you plug any power cords into the wall outlet 
or power strip. 
•  NEVER plug your TCL Roku TV into an outlet that is controlled by a wall 
switch. 
•  Turn off the TV before you connect or disconnect any cables. 
•  Make sure all antennas and cables are properly grounded. Refer to the 
Important Safety Instructions. 
Safety information 
•  Prevent TV from overheating by placing in an area with good ventilation. 
•  Do not block ventilation holes on the TV. Position the TV so air can circulate 
freely on all sides. 
•  Do not stack objects on the TV. 
•  If you place the TV on a stand, make sure you allow adequate ventilation. 
•  If you connect an audio receiver or amplifier to the TV, place it on the top shelf 
so the heated air will not overheat the TV. 
Avoid audio interference 
•  Position cables properly; insert each cable firmly into the designated jack. 
•  Route all cables down one side of the back of the TV instead of straight down 
the middle. 
•  If your antenna uses 300-ohm twin lead cables, do not coil the cables. 
•  Keep twin lead cables away from audio/video cables.

Avoid direct light 
Do not place the TV where sunlight or room lighting is directed toward the screen. 
Use soft or indirect lighting. 
Set up your new TV  
Open the box and remove the TV and other items. Be careful, the TV is heavy!  We 
strongly recommend that two people unbox the TV.   
Be sure to check all the foam packaging as the stands from some TV’s are stored in 
the foam for protection.  
What’s in the box 
 
 
To mount on a wall  
If you are mounting your TCL Roku TV to the wall, do not attach the TV base stand or 
TV stand column. 
	 	
6 
	 	
   
To mount your TV to the wall, purchase the one of the following VESA wall mounts: 
•  28" model  VESA 100 x 100, M4 x 12mm screws 
•  32" model  VESA 100 x 100, M4 x 12mm screws 
•  40" model  VESA 100 x 100, M4 x 25mm screws 
•  43" model  VESA 100 x 200, M4 x 25mm screws 
•  49" model  VESA 200 x 200, M6 x 16mm screws 
•  55" model  VESA 200 x 200, M6 x 16mm screws 
•  65" model  VESA 300 x 300, M6 x 16mm screws 
 
 
The VESA number is the horizontal and vertical measurement of the mounting holes. 
For example, 100 x 200 indicates that the mounting holes are spaced 100mm 
horizontally and 200mm vertically. 
Follow the directions supplied with the wall mount to mount the TV to the wall. 
Caution: Your wall mount must be able to bear a minimum of five times the TVs net 
weight to avoid damage. 
 
Note: The wall mount bracket and the screws are not included 
To use the stand 
Your TCL Roku TV comes without the stands attached so that you can choose to use 
the stands or mount your TV to a wall using a wall mount (sold separately). If you 
want to mount your TV to the wall, don’t attach the stand legs. 
A – Place the TV face down on a soft, cushioned surface on a table. The bag the TV 
was packed in makes a good cushion. Position the TV so that the stand, when 
attached, will hang over the edge of the table.

Connecting an antenna, cable, or satellite box 
If you are using an antenna, CATV cable without a set-top box, or a cable or 
satellite box that has only an antenna output, connect a 75-ohm coaxial 
cable (not provided) from the device to the ANT/CABLE input on the TV. 
Tip: If you are using an antenna with a 300 ohm twin-lead cable, you need to 
use a 300-to-75 ohm adapter (not provided) to adapt the twin-lead cable to 
a connection that is compatible with the TV’s antenna input. 
Tip: If you receive your TV stations through a set top box from a cable or 
satellite TV provider, connect it to the TV using the best connection method 
available. From most to least desirable: 
•  HDMI® input – Digital HD and SD video 
•  AV input – analog SD video 
•  Antenna input – analog SD video using NTSC 
	 	
8 
	 	
   
Connecting external equipment with a composite 
AV video cable 
If the best connection available on your component is AV or composite video output, 
connect it to the TV using a composite AV cable (not provided). Composite AV 
cables typically have three RCA-type plugs on each end, color coded as follows:  
•  Yellow – Video  
•  Red – Audio, right channel 
•  White or black – Audio, left channel 
Connect each plug to the corresponding connector on the component and on the TV. 
Note: Select models have an AV Input that looks like a headphone jack. Use the 
breakout cable (included) to adapt this input to the three RCA-type plugs on your 
composite cable.  
Connecting external equipment with an HDMI® cable 
If possible, connect your devices using HDMI® cables (not provided). They help to 
provide the best video quality and also carry audio signals, so that only one cable 
is needed. For better picture quality, we recommend that you use cables 
designated as High Speed HDMI® Cables. 
Tip: You might need to configure the component to send its signal through its 
HDMI® connector. 
The connector labeled HDMI IN (ARC) has the additional ability to use the audio 
return channel to send digital audio to a receiver or sound bar, as explained in 
Connecting an AV receiver or digital sound bar.  
		 	
9 
	 	
	  
Connecting headphones or analog sound bar to the 
TV 
You can connect headphones or an analog sound bar (not provided) to the TV’s 
headphone jack. 
Tip: Inserting a plug in the headphone jack disables the sound from the TV’s built-in 
speakers. 
Warning: Loud noise can damage your hearing. When using headphones, use the 
lowest volume setting on your headphones that still lets you hear the sound. 
Select models also have an audio line out connection that is not affected by TV 
volume or mute settings and does not disable the TV speakers. Use this connection 
when you want to use your amplifier or sound bar to control the TV volume. To 
turn off the TV’s built-in speakers, in the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > 
Audio > TV speakers and change the setting.  
Connecting an AV receiver or digital sound bar 
You can enjoy Dolby Audio™ multichannel sound from your TV if you connect a 
digital amplifier or sound bar (not provided) in either of two ways: 
•  Digital optical audio out (S/PDIF) – Connect a TOSLINK optical cable (not 
provided) from the TV to the Optical input on your receiver or sound bar. 
•  HDMI® ARC – Connect an HDMI® cable (not provided) from the HDMI (ARC) 
connector to the HDMI® input on your receiver or sound bar. This 
connection uses the Audio Return Channel (ARC) feature of the HDMI® 
specification to output sound from the TV to a compatible device. To use 
this feature, you must configure the TV to enable HDMI® ARC, as explained 
in Enable HDMI® ARC.

Preparing for Internet connectivity 
If you want to watch streaming content and take advantage of the cool features of 
your TCL • Roku TV, connect it to the Internet through a wireless modem/router or a 
wireless access point (not provided). The TV has a built-in wireless LAN adapter.  
Note: The TV supports only its internal wireless network adapter—it does not support 
the use of a USB network adapter. 
Select 4K models have wired in addition to wireless network connectivity. To use the 
wired network connection, connect an RJ-45 Ethernet cable (not provided) from the 
jack on the back of your TV to your network router or switch. The wired connection 
supports both 10 Base-T and 100 Base-T Ethernet. 
		 	
11 
	 	
	  
AC power 
Plug your TV into a power outlet. You can tell that the TV has power because the 
status light on the front of the TV lights up when the TV is off.  
The topic Status light explains how the status indicator shows what is happening with 
the TV. 
Remote control batteries 
Open the back of your TCL • Roku TV remote control and insert the included 
batteries, observing the proper orientation as indicated in the battery compartment. 
Reattach the back cover. 
 
TCL • Roku TV Remote control 
Use the following information to identify the buttons on your TCL • Roku TV remote

Guided Setup 
With the preliminaries out of the way, it’s time to turn on your TV. As the TV starts for 
the first time, it leads you through Guided Setup, which configures the TV before you 
start to use it. 
During Guided Setup, you’ll: 
•  Answer a few questions 
•  Provide network connection information 
•  Get a software update 
•  Link your TV to your Roku account. 
•  Connect devices such as a DVD player, game console, or cable box. 
Starting Guided Setup 
To start Guided Setup, press the POWER button on the remote control to turn on 
your TV.  
Note: Guided Setup normally runs only once, the first time you turn on your TV. If you 
need to run Guided Setup again, you’ll have to perform a factory reset, as explained in 
Factory reset everything. 
When you first turn on your TV, it will take a few seconds to get itself ready. You’ll 
notice the following things happening: 
1.  The status light blinks every time the TV is busy doing something; in this case 
it’s powering up and getting ready for you. 
2.  The power-on screen appears and the status light blinks slowly for a few more 
seconds. The power-on screen shows a brand logo while the TV starts up. 
3.  After a few seconds, Guided Setup starts. 
		 	
17 
	 	
	  
Completing Guided Setup 
Follow these steps to complete Guided Setup. At this point, you should be seeing the 
Language screen. 
 
Tip: On TVs sold in the United States, if you are blind or visually impaired, you 
can activate Audio Guide, a text-to-speech screen reader to help you navigate 
the TV’s menus and commands. To enable the Audio Guide, press the Þ button 
on the remote control four times in rapid succession. Repeat to disable Audio 
Guide. (The Þ button is located directly below the directional pad on the right 
side of the Roku remote control.) 
Note: If you enabled Audio Guide, choosing any language other than English 
disables it. 
1.  Press the DOWN arrow on the remote control to highlight your preferred 
language, and then press OK or the RIGHT arrow.  
	 	
18 
	 	
   
2.  Some models have a country selection screen: If you don’t see this screen, skip 
ahead to the next step. If you see this screen, select your country. 
 
Note: If you enabled Audio Guide, choosing any country other than United 
States disables it. 
3.  Press OK or the RIGHT arrow on the remote control to go to the next screen: 
 
Note: Some models show the title First things first instead of Set up environment. 
		 	
19 
	 	
	  
4.  Press OK to select Set up for home use. This is the right choice for enjoying your 
TV at home. It provides energy saving options as well as access to all features 
of the TV. 
Note: Store mode configures the TV for retail display and is not recommended 
for any other use. In store mode, some features of the TV are missing or 
limited. To switch from one mode to the other, you have to perform a factory 
reset as explained in Factory reset everything, and then repeat Guided Setup. 
Network connection 
After you select Set up for home use, the TV prompts you to make a network 
connection. If your TV has both wired and wireless connections, you’ll see the 
following screen. 
 
	 	
20 
	 	
   
5.  Only models that display the Connect to the Internet screen: Make a selection:  
•  Wireless connection – Highlight Set up new wireless connection and press OK. 
The TV prompts you through wireless setup. Skip ahead to the next step for 
help with the process. 
•  Wired connection – Highlight Connect to wired network and press OK. The TV 
immediately attempts to connect to your wired network, your local 
network, and then the Internet. Go to Step 9 to continue with Guided Setup. 
•  Connect to the Internet later – If you don’t want to connect to the Internet right 
now, you can skip this step and use the TV to watch Antenna TV channels, 
play games, and watch DVDs. When you’re ready to connect, it’s easy. We’ll 
show you how in Benefits of connecting. 
Note: If you decide not to connect, Guided Setup skips ahead to setting up 
the devices that you’ve connected to your TV. Jump ahead to Connect your 
devices to complete Guided Setup. 
6.  On models that have wireless only, or models with both wired and wireless and 
you’ve selected Wireless: The TV scans for the wireless networks within range 
and displays them in order, with the strongest signals first. In addition to your 
own wireless signal, the TV might pick up signals from your neighbors. 
 
		 	
21 
	 	
	  
Press the UP or DOWN arrows to highlight the name of your wireless network, 
and then press OK to select it. 
Note: Some networks, such as those often found in dorm rooms, hotels, and 
other public places, require you to read and agree to terms, enter a code, or 
provide identifying information before letting you connect to the Internet. If 
your TCL • Roku TV detects that you are connecting to such a network, it 
prompts you through the connection process using your compatible 
smartphone or tablet to provide the needed information. For more information, 
see Using your TV in a hotel or dorm room. 
Other options 
•  Connect to the Internet later – If you don’t want to connect to the Internet right 
now, you can skip this step and use the TV to watch Antenna TV channels, 
play games, and watch DVDs. When you’re ready to connect, it’s easy. We’ll 
show you how in Benefits of connecting. 
Note: If you decide not to connect, Guided Setup skips ahead to setting up 
the devices that you’ve connected to your TV. Jump ahead to Connect your 
devices to continue. 
•  Scan again / Scan again to see all networks – The name of this option depends 
on the number of wireless networks within range.  
o  Scan again appears if the list already shows all available wireless 
networks within range. If you don’t see your wireless network name in 
the list, you might need to adjust the location of your wireless router or 
the TV, turn on your router, or make other changes. When everything is 
ready, select Scan again to see if your network name now appears in the 
list. 
o  Scan again to see all networks appears if there are more wireless networks 
than the strongest ones it initially listed. If you don’t see your wireless 
network name in the list, this option displays the complete list. If you still 
	 	
22 
	 	
   
don’t see your network name, you might have your router configured to 
provide wireless service as a “private network.” 
Note: Highlighting either of these options displays an informational panel 
with the unique media access control (MAC) address of your TCL • Roku 
TV. You will need the MAC address if your wireless router is configured 
to use MAC address filtering. 
•  Private network – If your wireless network name is hidden, it won’t appear in 
the list. Select Private network to display an on-screen keyboard, and use it to 
enter your network name. Unless you changed the factory-set network 
name, you can find the name (also called SSID) on a label on the router.  
Tip: Wireless networks that are password-protected display a “padlock” icon 
adjacent to the name. This icon enables you to know that you are going to 
be prompted to enter a password after you select that network. 
 
7.  Only if you select a password protected wireless network: An on-screen 
keyboard appears. Use the keyboard to enter the network password.  
 
		 	
23 
	 	
	  
After you submit your wireless network password, the TV displays progress 
messages as it connects to your wireless network, your local network, and the 
Internet. 
8.  Only if your TV cannot get the correct time zone and current time from your 
network service provider: Use the UP and DOWN arrows to highlight your time 
zone, and then press OK. 
 
Tip: Your TV needs to know the local time zone so that it can correctly display 
information about the program you are currently watching. If the TV is unable 
to automatically determine the local time zone, it prompts you to choose your 
time zone from a list.  
As soon as the TV is able to connect to the Internet, it downloads and installs 
its first software update, and then restarts. 
Tip: Your TV automatically checks for updates periodically. These updates 
provide new features and improve your overall experience with the TV. After 
an update, you might notice that some options have moved, and that there are 
new options or features. This User Guide describes version 8.0. To determine 
your current TCL • Roku TV software version, go to Settings > System > About 
after you complete Guided Setup. You can download an updated User Guide 
	 	
24 
	 	
   
that matches your TCL • Roku TV software version from the TCL • Roku TV 
web site. 
Activation 
After the TV restarts, it displays the Activation screen: 
 
9.  Using a compatible computer, tablet, or smartphone with an Internet 
connection, go to the web address displayed on the screen and enter the code 
that appears on your screen.  
 
Why do I need a Roku account? 
You need a Roku account for several reasons: 
•  It links you, your TCL • Roku TV, and your other Roku streaming devices to the 
Roku Channel Store and billing service. 
•  Streaming content providers know that it’s OK to send content you request to 
your TCL • Roku TV. 
•  Roku can automatically send updates to your device. 
You need a Roku account to activate your device and access entertainment across 
thousands of streaming channels. Roku accounts are free, and while a valid credit card 
number is not required to create your account, providing your credit card information 
		 	
25 
	 	
	  
makes renting and purchasing entertainment from the Roku Channel Store fast and 
convenient. 
 
After you log in or create your Roku account, the link page suggests that you 
select some streaming channels. After you confirm your selections, the TV gets 
an acknowledgement, and then adds your preexisting and newly-selected 
streaming channels to your TCL • Roku TV. This process is automatic and takes 
a few moments—a little longer if you already have a lot of streaming channels 
to add.  
Tip: Streaming channels from all Roku streaming devices associated with your 
account are synchronized periodically, so that all of your Roku streaming 
devices have the same set of streaming channels (subject to compatibility with 
the device). 
Connect your devices 
Next, Guided Setup helps you set up the external devices that you want to use 
with it, such as a cable box, Blu-ray™ player, or game console. 
 
	 	
26 
	 	
   
10. Press OK or the RIGHT arrow to proceed: 
 
11.  Connect all the devices you plan to use with your TV, turn them all on, and then 
select Everything is plugged in and turned on. The TV now takes you step by step 
through each of its inputs and asks what kind of device you have connected. 
On each input that has a connected and active device, you can see its picture 
and hear its sound. 
 
12. Press the UP or DOWN arrows to highlight the label you want to associate with 
the input. If you are not using the input, select Nothing, and the input won’t 
appear on the Home screen. 
		 	
27 
	 	
	  
13. While setting up your devices, rather than using the predefined names and 
icons, you can set a custom name and icon. To do so, scroll up or down to 
highlight Set custom name & icon, and then press OK. Follow the instructions on 
the screen to enter a name and select an icon for the input. See Rename inputs 
for more information. 
14. Note: If you have renamed the inputs, you cannot use voice commands to 
switch inputs. Voice commands can only switch among inputs that have their 
original names, such as “AV,” and “HDMI 1.” 
15. Repeat the previous step for each input. 
You’re done with Guided Setup.  
 
Note: Some TCL • Roku TVs, depending on where you live and other factors, show you 
an introductory video filled with some great hints and tips. If you’re not interested in 
viewing this video, press    on the remote control to return to the TCL • Roku TV 
Home screen. 
Whenever you press   on the remote control, the Home screen greets you. 
From here, you can explore everything your TV has to offer. Press the arrow keys to 
move around, and press OK to select a highlighted item. We’ve designed the TV to 
encourage you to explore, and you can probably figure out most of the capabilities

What is streaming? 
Streaming is viewing or listening to video or audio content that is sent over the 
Internet, or located on a network-connected media server or on a USB device 
plugged into the TV’s USB port.  
With streaming, you can buy or rent most programs on demand, when it’s convenient 
for you. When streaming, you can play, pause, rewind, and fast forward most of what  
you are watching. You can also replay the last few seconds again, or turn on closed 
captions.  
Tip: Some content cannot be paused or skipped. For example, if you are viewing live 
programming or a program that is supported by ads, you might not be allowed to 
skip the ads. 
Your TCL • Roku TV lets you choose from thousands of streaming channels that offer 
a huge selection of entertainment: 
•  Thousands of movies and TV episodes 
•  Unlimited music, live and on-demand 
•  Tons of live and on-demand sports  
•  Commercial-free kids programming 
•  International programming in 22 languages 
•  24x7 news and in-depth news commentary 
Many streaming channels are free. Some streaming channels, like Google Play, let you 
purchase or rent the latest movie releases or popular TV series. Some channels such 
as Netflix or Acorn TV charge a monthly subscription fee and others are available at 
no additional cost if you subscribe to a companion service through your cable or 
satellite provider.  
If you have an existing subscription to a service like Netflix, you can just sign in with 
your existing user name and password. 
	 	
34 
	 	
   
To play streaming content, you add streaming channels to your Home screen. Use the 
Streaming Channels option on the Home screen menu to go to the Roku Channel Store, 
and then select the streaming channel you want to add. The channel remains on your 
Home screen unless you remove it, and you can watch it at any time. 
For more information on using the Roku Channel Store feature, see Using the Roku 
Channel Store. 
Note: A paid subscription or other payments may be required for some channels. 
Channel availability is subject to change and varies by country. Not all content is 
available in countries or regions where Roku® products are sold. 
What if I didn’t connect my TV? 
What if you went through Guided Setup and chose Connect to the Internet later? No 
worries. Your TCL • Roku TV makes it easy to connect whenever you want. As you 
move around the Home screen, you’ll see several places where you can start the 
connection process. For example: 
•  Now and then you’ll see a message appear on the panel to the right of the 
Home screen offering a Connect Now option. Simply highlight and select the 
Connect Now option to get started.  
•  Use the Connect and activate now option in the Settings menu. From the Home 
screen menu, select Settings, then Network, and then Connect and activate now. 
•  If you want to start over from the beginning, use the Settings menu to do a 
Factory reset, and then go through Guided Setup again. This time, choose your 
home network when prompted.

Setting up Antenna TV 
In addition to the other entertainment possibilities of your TCL • Roku TV, you may 
also want to watch broadcast channels from an antenna or cable TV service 
connected to the ANT input. On your TCL • Roku TV, you watch broadcast TV in 
much the same way you watch other entertainment choices. You select a tile—in this 
case, the Antenna TV tile—from the Home screen. 
The first time you select the Antenna TV tile, you have to set up the TV tuner. Setting 
up the TV tuner scans for active channels and adds them to your Antenna TV channel 
list.  
 
Why do I have to set up the TV tuner? 
Not everyone needs to use the TV tuner. For example, you might have a set top box provided 
by a cable or satellite company that receives all of your channels. Most of these set top boxes 
use an HDMI® connection.  
More and more people are watching only streaming TV and do not have a TV antenna or 
cable/satellite service. If you don’t need the TV tuner, you can bypass setting it up and instead 
remove it from the Home screen as explained in Remove unwanted tiles. 
When you set up Antenna TV, the TV scans the signals on its antenna input for channels with a 
good signal, and adds those to the channel list, skipping dead channels and channels with a 
very weak signal. 
The TV lets you add two analog channels, even if they have no signal, for the purpose of using 
an older set top box, VCR, or game console that can only output a signal on analog channel 3 
or 4. Typically, you’ll only need one of these channels, but both are provided to make setup 
simpler. You can hide the one you don’t want as explained in Edit Antenna TV channel lineup. 
 
	 	
36 
	 	
   
How do I set up the TV tuner? 
1.  Make sure your antenna (not provided) or TV cable is connected to the TV’s 
ANT/CABLE input. 
2.  On the Home screen, select the Antenna TV tile. 
3.  Read the simple on-screen instructions, and then select Start finding channels. 
 
4.  If prompted, select your time zone. You’ll only need to do this if the TV can’t 
figure out your time zone from your Internet connection. 
 
		 	
37 
	 	
	  
 
Why does the TV need my time zone? 
The TV needs to know your time zone so that it can correctly display time information 
about the program you are currently watching. 
 
5.  When prompted, select whether to add analog channels 3 and 4. These 
channels enable you to connect older set top boxes, VCRs, or game consoles. 
 
6.  Wait while your TV scans for Antenna TV stations…  
 
	 	
38 
	 	
   
… and then cable TV channels.  
 
Scanning for channels can take several minutes.    
Tip: If you use a set-top box to receive cable TV channels (and don’t have your 
cable connected directly to the TV’s ANT input), you can save time by skipping 
the cable TV portion of the channel scan. 
7.  When the channel scans finish, the TV shows the number of channels it added. 
 
8.  Only in connected mode, you have the option of setting up Live TV Pause. The 
topic Pausing Live TV explains how to set up and use this feature. If you don’t 
		 	
39 
	 	
	  
want to set up Live TV Pause, or if this option is not available to you, select 
Done to start watching Live TV. 
Tip: Repeat the channel scan from time to time to make sure you are receiving all 
of the latest channels. Broadcasters add and remove channels, move channels to 
different parts of the spectrum, and change the power levels of their channels 
periodically. Your antenna reception and picture quality depend on the position of 
your antenna and on your location relative to the antennas of broadcasters in your 
area. 
Note: You’ll have to repeat the channel scan if you remove and re-add the Antenna 
TV tile from the Home screen or perform a factory reset. To repeat the channel 
scan, go to Settings > TV inputs > Antenna TV > Scan again for channels > Start finding 
channels. 
Now, you’re ready to watch Antenna TV! While you’re watching, try the following tips: 
•  Press the UP and DOWN arrows to change channels. 
•  Press the LEFT arrow to display the channel list (non-connected mode) or 
Smart Guide (connected mode), and then use the UP and DOWN arrows to 
select a channel to watch. Or press REWIND or FAST FORWARD to jump 
through the channel list or Smart Guide a page at a time. 
•  Press OK to display information about the current program. 
•  Press Þ to see options for picture and sound settings.

Using your TV 
This section provides information on using the day-to-day features of your TV. 
Status light 
Your TV has a single status light on the front panel. It goes on and off and blinks in 
different ways depending on the status of the TV, as shown in the following table: 
TV CONDITION  STATUS INDICATOR  MEANING 
On (screen is active)  Off  Screen is communicating that TV is on. 
Screensaver (screen is active)  Off  Screen is communicating that TV is on. 
Off (no power)  Off  TV is not connected to power.

mode  reaches standby. 
		 	
41 
	 	
	  
 
Standby mode energy savings 
When you turn off your TV, it remains in a higher power mode for a few minutes, after 
which it goes into a very low power standby mode. If you turn on the TV again before 
it has entered the very low power mode, it turns on immediately. After the TV goes 
into the lower power standby mode, it takes a few seconds longer to start up. 
Only in connected mode on TVs that do not have an Energy Star® rating, you can 
optionally enable Fast TV start. When this option is enabled, your TV starts up almost 
immediately regardless of how long it has been turned off, but uses somewhat more 
power in standby mode. For more information, see Fast TV start. 
Opting in to Smart TV experience (U.S. only) 
Only in connected mode in the United States, the first time you select Antenna TV, an 
HDMI input, or AV input, your TV offers to enable the Smart TV experience. If you 
decide to enable it at this time, you’re all set to enjoy its recommendations and 
features. 
 
	 	
42 
	 	
   
The Smart TV experience uses automatic content recognition (ACR) and other 
technology to collect information about what you watch through your Antenna TV, 
and on devices like media players and cable boxes connected to the HDMI or AV 
inputs. Opting in means that you give permission to analyze the programs you watch 
for the purpose of making recommendations, as well showing ads that are more 
relevant to you. 
If you decide not to enable the Smart TV experience at this first opportunity, you can 
enable it later. Or, if you decide you’d rather not use the feature, you can disable it, 
but be aware that previously collected information is retained and not deleted. 
Disable Smart TV experience 
If you decide you want to disable Smart TV experience, follow these steps: 
1.  From the Home screen, go to Settings > Privacy > Smart TV experience.  
2.  Navigate to the right to highlight Use info from TV inputs. 
3.  Press OK on the remote control to clear the check box. 
Disable Auto Notifications 
If you want to keep the Smart TV experience enabled, but you do not want to see 
notifications while you are watching shows, you can disable notifications. To do so, 
follow these steps: 
1.  From the Home screen, go to Settings > Privacy > Smart TV experience.  
2.  Navigate to the right to highlight Use info from TV inputs. 
3.  Press DOWN on the remote control to highlight Enable auto notifications. 
4.  Press OK on the remote control to clear the check box. 
Note: These settings do not affect recommendations for More Ways to Watch that 
you see in the Smart Guide when watching Antenna TV channels. Those 
recommendations come from the Smart Guide and do not rely on ACR technology.

TV shows through the Antenna TV input. The Smart Guide lets you scroll through all 
TV channels (except those you have hidden, if any). You can see all the shows from 
today, the previous 7 days, and the upcoming 14 days. 
The ability to see shows that have already aired during the previous week enables you 
to use More Ways to Watch to catch up on missed movies or episodes by selecting 
them from one of the streaming channels. Your clue that there are More Ways to 
Watch a show is a purple asterisk (Þ) next to the program name in the guide. 
For example, you might turn on your TV at 10 minutes past the hour and discover you 
are missing the current episode of Empire. But, there is a purple asterisk next to the 
show title, so you can press Þ and find that there are several streaming channels 
where you can watch the current episode from the beginning. You also can find more 
episodes of Empire, and other shows that have a similar theme.

rewind digital Antenna TV. You can pause Antenna TV for up to 90 minutes. 
Requirements 
To use this feature, you need to: 
1.  Connect your TV to the Internet. If you didn’t connect during Guided Setup, see 
What if I didn’t connect my TV?. 
2.  Provide your own dedicated USB drive with the following minimum 
specifications.  
•  16 GB 
•  15 Mbps read/write speed 
•  USB 2.0 compliant 
A USB flash drive (thumb drive) meeting the minimum requirements is highly 
recommended. Note that using a larger drive does not extend the 90 minute 
pause time. 
Important: All existing content on your USB drive is erased when you enable this 
feature. 
3.  Connect your USB drive to the TV’s USB port. 
		 	
51

received through the TV’s ANT input (ATSC and Clear QAM channels). 
•  Changing channels erases and restarts the Live TV Pause buffer. 
•  Returning to the Home screen, selecting another input, or turning off the TV 
erases and resets the Live TV Pause buffer. 
•  Removing the USB drive erases the Live TV Pause buffer. 
More Ways to Watch (U.S. only) 
Only in connected mode in the United States, More Ways to Watch gives you 
recommendations about the shows you’re watching on the Antenna TV, HDMI, or AV 
input. You will automatically get these recommendations in the Smart Guide and in 
the program information banner for Antenna TV programs. However, before you can 
get recommendations for shows you’re watching through the HDMI or AV inputs, you 
must opt into the Smart TV experience to acknowledge that you want to allow the TV 
to use automatic content recognition (ACR). See Opting in to Smart TV experience 
for details. 
Not every show provides recommendations. For details about what you’ll see when a 
recommendation appears, see Using More Ways to Watch.  
	 	
54 
	 	
   
Using More Ways to Watch 
As  you use More Ways to Watch, be aware that you’ll only see suggestions on your 
TV when all of the following conditions are met: 
•  Your TV is operating in connected mode in the United States. 
•  If you are watching shows through and HDMI or AV input, you’ve enabled Smart 
TV experience. (If you are watching Antenna TV channels, this setting does not 
matter.) 
•  The program you’re watching contains the information needed to identify it. 
Note that some programs, such as the daily news, typically do not activate 
More Ways to Watch. 
•  At least one participating streaming channel offers the movie or TV show you 
are watching, or other episodes, or more shows like the one you are watching.  
If all of these conditions are met, you can view the suggestions. More Ways to Watch 
recommendations appear in several places: 
•  When watching the HDMI and AV inputs, you’ll see a More Ways to Watch 
notification in the lower right corner of the screen for a few seconds unless you 
have disabled Enable auto notifications: 
 
Note: After this banner disappears, you can restore the More Ways to Watch 
prompt by pressing OK. 
		 	
55 
	 	
	  
•  For shows on Antenna TV channels, check the program information banner 
that appears for a few moments when you change channels or when you press 
OK while watching a show. If your TV has suggestions, you’ll see a More Ways to 
Watch notification in the banner:  
 
•  In the Smart Guide, you can view More Ways to Watch recommendations on 
any program that shows a purple asterisk Þ next to its title: 
 
Regardless of which More Ways to Watch prompt appears, press Þ to see the 
recommendations. The options you’ll see depend on the type of show you’re 
	 	
56 
	 	
   
watching and the available ways there are to watch, so you might see any or all of the 
following: 
 
•  Watch from beginning – Streaming channels on which the same TV show or 
movie is available. Generally, this option does not appear on first run programs, 
because streaming content is not available until a later date. 
•  More episodes – Streaming channels where you can find other episodes of the 
TV show you are watching. Does not apply to movies. 
•  More like this –TV shows or movies with a similar theme. 
•  View full description – Full description of the selected show. 
Press the DOWN arrow to select an option, and then press the RIGHT arrow to select 
the channel you want to use to watch from the beginning or watch more episodes, or 
the other TV show or movie with a similar theme.  
Assuming you’ve already added the channel and completed any required sign-in, 
More Ways to Watch takes you directly to the program in the streaming channel 
where you can select and watch the program. Otherwise, it prompts you to add the 
channel and, if you do, then takes you to the show. 
		 	
57 
	 	
	  
Getting the most from More Ways to Watch 
•  Streaming channels you’ve already installed appear first in the list of 
suggestions. 
•  When you select a streaming channel, you leave the program you are currently 
watching.  
•  If you’ve used the Live TV Pause feature to pause the program, your paused 
program buffer is deleted. In other words, you cannot return to an Antenna TV 
channel and resume watching where you left off. 
Switching TV inputs 
Switch TV inputs to access the device connected to that input, for example, a 
Blu-ray™ player. Switching inputs is as simple as highlighting the input’s tile in the 
Home screen, and pressing OK. The video signal on the input, if any, plays on the 
screen. 
Tip: To learn how to add, remove, rename, and rearrange the tiles on your Home 
screen, see Customizing your TV. 
Auto-detecting devices 
Your TV automatically detects when you connect a new device to an HDMI® input and 
turn on its power. The input is automatically added to the Home screen if it isn’t 
already present. 
Adjusting audio/video settings 
While watching video content on any input, press Þ to display the Options menu. 
Press the UP and DOWN arrows to highlight an option, and then press the LEFT and

Playing content from USB storage devices 
Only in connected mode, your Home screen has the Roku Media Player tile. Otherwise, 
the Home screen has the USB Media Player tile. You can play personal music, video, 
and photo files from a personal USB flash drive or hard disk connected to the TV’s 
USB port. 
To use this feature, make sure your media files are compatible with the Roku/USB 
Media Player. To see the latest list of supported formats, view Help in the Media 
Player*. The Roku/USB Media Player displays supported file types only, and hides file 
types it knows it cannot play. 
For more information about playing back your personal videos, music, and photos, go 
to the following link on the Roku web site: 
go.roku.com/rokumediaplayer 
Auto player launch 
Only in connected mode, you can set your TV to automatically open the Roku Media 
Player when you connect a USB drive with a recognizable file system (such as 
FAT16/32, NTFS, HFS+ or EXT2/3). To configure this setting, from the Home screen, 
navigate to Settings > System > USB media. At this point, the following options are 
available: 
•  Auto-launch – Choose Prompt, On, or Off, as desired. 
o  Prompt – (default) Display a prompt each time a recognized USB drive is 
connected. The prompt provides options to launch the Roku Media Player 
as well as to change future auto-play behavior. 
o  On – Always launch the Roku Media Player whenever you connect a 
recognized USB drive. 
                                             
*  There are many variants of each supported media format. Some variants may not play at all or may have issues or 
inconsistencies during playback. 
		 	
59 
	 	
	  
o  Off – Never launch the Roku Media Player automatically. 
•  Launch channel – Choose the app you want to use to play back media files. 
Playing content from local network media servers 
Only in connected mode, your TV can play personal video, music, and photo files from 
a media server on your local network. Media servers include personal computers 
running media server software such as Plex or Windows Media Player, network file 
storage systems that have built-in media server software, and other devices that 
implement the specifications of the Digital Living Network Alliance. Some servers do 
not fully implement the DLNA specification but are UPNP (Universal Plug and Play) 
compatible. The Roku Media Player will connect to them as well. 
Some media servers can convert files into Roku compatible formats. DRM-protected 
content is not supported. 
Using your TV in a hotel or dorm room 
Hotels, school dorms, conference facilities, and similar locations with public wireless 
Internet access often require you to interact with a web page to authenticate your 
access. These types or networks are called restricted public networks . When you 
select a network of this type, the TV automatically detects that additional information 
is needed and prompts you through using another wireless device to supply the 
requested information. 
About using your TV on a restricted public network 
Here are some points to keep in mind when using your TV on a restricted public 
network: 
	 	
60 
	 	
   
•  Using your TCL • Roku TV on a hotel or dorm room network requires wireless 
availability and a network-connected smartphone, tablet, or computer to 
authenticate access to your wireless access point.  
•  You will need your TCL • Roku TV remote control. 
•  Some content might be limited or unavailable if you try to connect outside 
your home country due to geo-filtering. 
Getting your TCL • Roku TV on line on a restricted public network 
1.  Either during Guided Setup or after using the Settings > Network menu to set up 
a new connection, the TV automatically detects that you are connecting to a 
restricted network and displays the following prompt: 
 
Tip: Your TV can connect to a restricted network only if Enable ‘Device connect’ 
is selected in Settings > System > Advanced system settings. (Device connect is 
enabled by default, but if you have disabled it, the TV cannot complete the 
connection.)  
Note: Device connect is not present if the TV is in non-connected mode. 
		 	
61 
	 	
	  
2.  After selecting the correct network, highlight I am at a hotel or college dorm, and 
then press OK. The TV prompts you to use your smartphone, tablet, or laptop 
to complete the connection. 
 
3.  Use a phone, tablet, or wireless-enabled computer to detect wireless networks. 
In most cases, you can simply open the device’s Wi-Fi Settings or Network 
Settings screen to start scanning. 
Note: The phone, tablet, or computer must be on the same wireless network to 
which you are connecting the TV. 
4.  Connect to the network named on your TV screen. The actual network name 
varies.  
Note: The previous step connects your smartphone, tablet, or computer directly 
to the TV. No connection charges apply and the connection does not impact 
your device’s data plan. 
5.  The wireless connection process prompts you for a password. Enter the 
password as shown on the TV screen. The actual password varies. 
6.  Start the web browser on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. When you 
attempt to open any web page, the restricted connection will prompt you for 
whatever information it needs. In most cases, you must agree to terms and 
	 	
62 
	 	
   
conditions, provide identifying information, or enter a password, PIN, or room 
number to proceed. The information requested depends on the organization 
that controls the wireless connection. 
7.  After you enter the requested information, the TV automatically proceeds to 
complete its connection and resumes normal operation.  
8.  If the TV prompts you to link to your Roku account, use your smartphone, 
tablet, or computer to complete the pairing operation and activate your TCL • 
Roku TV. 
		 	
63 
	 	
	  
Adjusting TV settings 
You can adjust most picture and sound settings while you are watching a program by 
pressing Þ to open the Options menu. There are some additional picture and sound 
settings in the Settings menu. 
In most cases, the changes you make apply only to the input you are using. Antenna 
TV, the separate HDMI® inputs, and the AV input each have their own settings that the 
TV remembers when you return to that input. The TV also separately remembers the 
settings you specify while viewing streaming content. 
Settings menu 
Use the Settings menu to adjust overall TV settings. Press   to go to the Home 
screen, and then navigate to Settings > TV picture settings. 
You can adjust the following overall TV picture settings from the Settings screen: 
•  TV brightness – Provide a better viewing experience in darker or brighter rooms. 
Increases or decreases the TV’s general brightness across all TV inputs. 
Note: This setting is identical to the TV brightness setting you can access in the 
Options menu while watching a program. 
•  HDR notification – On select models only: Controls whether the TV displays a 
notification in the upper right corner of the screen for a few seconds when 
HDR or Dolby Vision content begins to play. 
o  On – The TV displays a notification when HDR or Dolby Vision content 
begins to play. 
o  Off – The TV does not display a notification when HDR or Dolby Vision 
content begins to play. 
	 	
64 
	 	
   
Note: This setting does not affect the HDR or Dolby Vision notification that 
always appears in the program information banner. Press OK while watching a 
show to open the program information banner. 
•  120 Hz – On select models only: Enables a higher picture refresh rate. 
o  On – the TV uses a higher refresh rate, which produces less motion blur. 
o  Off – the TV uses a 60Hz refresh rate. 
Note: The 120 Hz setting is also available in each input’s Options menu, but is not 
an input-specific setting. The current setting of the control applies to all inputs. 
•  Settings per input – Lists each TV input. Select an input, and then press Þ to 
display the Options menu where you can adjust the input’s settings while 
watching a live picture and listening to the sound from that input. 
Tip: You don’t have to go to the Settings menu first—you can display an input’s 
Options menu and adjust its settings whenever you are watching the input by 
pressing Þ. 
Options menu 
The Options menu for each TV input provides many settings for controlling the 
appearance of the picture and the quality of the audio. To view the Options menu, 
		 	
65 
	 	
	  
press Þ whenever you are watching a TV input or streaming a video. The Options 
menu is a panel that appears over the left side of the screen:

•  Backlight - Adjusts the overall light intensity of the screen. On some models, this 
option is disabled when Dynamic contrast is enabled. 
•  Brightness – Adjusts the dark level of the black areas of the picture. 
•  Contrast – Adjusts the white level of the light areas of the picture. 
•  Sharpness – Adjusts the sharpness of the edges of objects in the picture. 
•  Color – Adjusts the intensity of colors in the picture. A setting of 0 removes all 
color and displays a black and white picture. 
•  Tint – Adjusts the color balance from green to red to obtain accurate colors in 
the picture. 
•  Color temperature – Adjusts the overall colors in the picture from Normal to 
slightly more bluish (Cool) to slightly more reddish (Warm). 
•  Game mode – Only on HDMI® and AV inputs: Controls whether Game mode is 
enabled. When On, the TV performs less image processing and has less input 
lag. When Off, the TV performs more image processing and has more input lag, 
which is less desirable for action games.

Changing privacy settings 
Note: Privacy settings are not present on TVs operating in non-connected mode. 
Advertising 
Only in connected mode, by default your TV uses an advertising identifier to track 
your TV usage. You can change the privacy settings on your TV in two ways: 
resetting the advertising identifier and limiting ad tracking. 
Reset the advertising identifier 
Resetting the advertising identifier clears the prior usage history that your TV stores, 
and then begins tracking again. From that point forward, your new usage patterns 
affect the advertisements you see on your TV. 
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Privacy > Advertising. 
2.  Highlight Reset advertising identifier. Press Þ to view more information about this 
option. When you finishing reading the information, press OK to close the More

3.  Press OK to reset the advertising identifier, and then press OK again to dismiss 
the verification message. 
Limit ad tracking 
You can limit Roku’s tracking of your usage behavior by limiting ad tracking. When 
you do, your TV will display ads that are not personalized based on your TV’s 
advertising identifier.  
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Privacy > Advertising. 
2.  Highlight Limit ad tracking. Press Þ to view more information about this option. 
When you finish reading the information, press OK to close the More 
Information window. 
3.  Press OK to select the Limit ad tracking check box. 
Note: If you perform a factory reset and then reconnect your TV, ad tracking is 
restored until you repeat these steps. 
Microphone 
Your TCL • Roku TV does not have a built-in microphone. However streaming channel 
providers can use the microphone on the Roku Enhanced Remote Control (only on 
select models) or on your mobile device when the Roku mobile app is running. You 
can control whether streaming channels have permission to use the microphone. 
Note: These settings affect only streaming channel access to the microphone. They do 
not affect your TCL • Roku TV’s Voice Search feature. 
Channel microphone access 
You can control which streaming channels have permission to use  the microphone, 
giving you control over how the microphone is used by each streaming channel. The 
default setting is Prompt, so no channel will be able to turn on the microphone 
without your permission. 
		 	
75 
	 	
	  
To change microphone access settings: 
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Privacy > Microphone. 
2.  Select Channel microphone access. 
3.  Chose one of the following settings: 
•  Prompt – Display a notification each time any streaming channel requests 
the use of the microphone. When a notification appears, you can choose 
among Prompt, Always allow, and Never allow on a per-channel basis. 
•  Always allow – Do not prompt, but always allow any streaming channel to 
use the microphone. 
•  Never allow – Do not prompt, but never allow any streaming channel to use 
the microphone. 
Channel permissions 
After granting or denying microphone access on a per-channel basis, you can reset 
channel permissions to enable them to follow the system-wide setting you specify 
under Channel microphone access.

My Feed 
Only in connected mode, use My Feed to find out when you can watch movies 
coming soon, and to get updates on movies, TV shows, and actors that you are 
following.  
Movies Coming Soon 
My Feed gives you updates on your list of movies that are coming soon to theaters. 
With My Feed, you’ll know when your favorite movie is ready to stream, the channels 
it is on, and how much it will cost. 
Select the movies you want to follow by going to My Feed > Movies Coming Soon. You’ll 
then see a list of newly released movies that are not yet available on Roku streaming 
devices. Select a movie, and then select Follow this movie on Roku. When you return to 
the main My Feed screen, you’ll see banners for each of your newly-followed movies 
along with banners for movies and TV shows you’re already following.  
Movies, TV shows, and people 
In addition to following movies coming soon, you can follow any movie, TV show, or 
actor across top streaming channels. To follow a program, use the Search feature to 
find the movie, TV show, or name that you want to follow, and then select Follow this 
movie/TV show/person on Roku. For more information, see Searching for something to 
watch. 
Note: The TV takes a bit of time to update your newly-followed shows. Until it finds at 
least one channel offering the movie, the content banner in My Feed shows Check 
back later for updates. 
		 	
77 
	 	
	  
My Feed alerts you any time a movie or TV show you are following becomes available 
on another channel and whenever its price changes. A number in parentheses next to 
My Feed in the Home screen menu means that My Feed has updated information that 
you haven’t viewed yet. For example, if three of your followed shows have updates, 
you’ll see My Feed (3). 
Note: When a movie or TV show you are following becomes available, the streaming 
channel offering the movie might require that you subscribe or pay a fee to view it. 
	 	
78 
	 	
   
Searching for something 
to watch 
Searching for movies and shows across both Antenna TV (only in the United States) 
and streaming channels is one of the unique features of your TCL • Roku TV. Within a 
single search operation, you can search by: 
•  Movie name 
•  TV show name 
•  Actor or director name 
•  Streaming channel name 
•  Game name 
Note: Roku Search is not available if your TV is operating in non-connected mode. 
Roku Search doesn’t search across all streaming channels, but searches across lots of 
popular streaming channels. The actual channels it searches vary by locale. 
How do I search? 
You can search by using an on-screen keyboard that you navigate using the arrow 
keys on your remote control, or only in the United States, you can use the Roku 
Enhanced Remote Control or the Roku mobile app to search with your voice. 
. 
For more information about Voice Search, go to go.roku.com/voicesearch
		 	
79 
	 	
	  
Keyboard search using the remote control 
1.  Select Search on the Home screen menu.  
The Search screen has a keyboard grid and initially displays instructions—a set 
of icons representing search categories and a list of participating provider tiles. 
Tip: If you don’t see the instructions, navigate to the end of the list of recent 
searches and select Clear recent search selections. 
2.  Use the arrow keys to navigate the on-screen keyboard, entering a few 
characters of the search term.  
With each additional character you enter, you narrow down the search, making 
the search results more relevant. You’ll often see the results you are seeking 
after entering only a few letters. 
3.  When you see the show you are searching for, navigate to the right to highlight 
it.  
Searching from the Roku mobile app 
Use the free Roku mobile app on your compatible smartphone or tablet to make 
searching even faster. Use your mobile device’s keypad to type more quickly and 
easily than with the on-screen keyboard on your TV. Only in the United States, you 
also can search simply by touching the Voice Search icon and saying the name of the 
movie, TV show, actor or director, streaming channel, or game. 
When you use the Roku mobile app to search, search results are shown on your 
mobile device instead of on the TV screen. When you make a selection from the 
search results, the TV starts playing the selected program. 
For more information, see Getting and using the Roku mobile app. 
	 	
80 
	 	
   
I found a show, now what? 
Now that you’ve highlighted the show, movie, actor, game, or streaming channel you 
were looking for, press the RIGHT arrow.  
If your search result was an actor, director, or other item that does not represent a 
single item of content, you’ll see another list to narrow down your search. Continue 
highlighting results and pressing the RIGHT arrow until you find a single, viewable 
content item. 
 
•  The channel logo appears to the left of each result. 
•  Only in the United States, a LIVE TV logo indicates a program that is available on 
Antenna TV. Shows currently playing live appear at the top of the list. Shows airing in 
the future appear at the bottom of the list. Selecting a LIVE TV result switches the TV 
to that channel regardless of whether the program is currently in progress. 
•  An HD logo means that the content is available in high-definition.  
•  The checked circle adjacent to the title means you have already added the streaming 
channel. 
If your search result was a game or a streaming channel, you’ll see detailed 
information, images, and available actions, such as a list of streaming channels and the 
cost of getting the item or channel. 
Note: Some channels may require a paid subscription. 
		 	
81 
	 	
	  
Follow on Roku 
Rather than watch the show you found in Search, you can add it to My Feed and wait 
until it’s available on a particular streaming channel or available at a better price. From 
the search results screen, select Follow on Roku. Then go to My Feed periodically to 
check for updates to each of your followed movies, TV shows, or people. For more 
information, see My Feed. 
Recent Searches 
The next time you use Roku Search, the Search screen displays a list of recent search 
selections in place of the search instructions. 
Using the recent search selections list makes it easy to quickly get to a previously 
found item, for example, to find another movie with the same actor, or another TV 
show in the same series. 
	 	
82 
	 	
   
Using the Roku Channel 
Store 
Only in connected mode, the Streaming Channels menu option takes you to the Roku 
Channel store, where you can add new subscription based and free streaming 
channels to your TV.  
Tip: You also can search for streaming channels by using the Search option, as 
explained in Searching for something to watch. 
To make it easier to find what you want, the streaming channels in the Roku Channel 
Store are categorized by topic. Press the UP and DOWN arrows to highlight the 
category you want, and then press the RIGHT arrow to move the highlight into the 
grid of streaming channel tiles.  
When you find a streaming channel you want to add or learn more about, highlight it 
and press OK to display more details. 
•  If the streaming channel you are adding is free, you can select Go to channel to 
start watching it immediately.  
•  If there is a one-time or recurring fee associated with using the streaming 
channel, you must agree to the terms and conditions, accept the fee, and—if 
you created one when you activated your TCL • Roku TV, enter your Roku PIN 
code to authorize the charges. 
•  If you already have a subscription to the streaming channel—for example, you 
already subscribe to Netflix or you receive HBO through your cable TV 
provider—you must complete a different, simple authorization step to add the 
streaming channel. 
		 	
83 
	 	
	  
You need only complete the authorization or activation step one time, when you 
initially add the streaming channel. After that, you simply select the streaming channel 
tile from your Home screen to start watching. (Channel and content availability is 
subject to change. Charges may apply to your selection.) 
Tip: New streaming channels are added continuously to the Roku Channel Store, so be 
sure to check back every now and then for new options. 
Note: If you don’t remember your PIN, or if want to change whether you need to use a 
PIN to make purchases on your Roku account, see Changing your Roku Channel Store 
PIN preference.

Customizing your TV  
There are several things you can do to personalize your TV. 
Add TV inputs 
As you use your TV, you might find that you need to add a TV input tile that you did 
not add during Guided Setup. To add a TV input: 
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > TV inputs. Notice that the 
list of inputs is divided into two sections: Inputs being used and Inputs not used. 
2.  Press the UP or DOWN arrows to highlight an input in the Inputs not used section 
of the list. 
3.  Press the RIGHT arrow to move the highlight to Set up input. 
4.  Press OK to add the input. 
5.  Press   to return to the Home screen. Notice that the input has been added to 
the top of the Home screen. If you want to move the input tile to a different 
position in the grid, see Rearrange tiles. 
Add streaming channels 
You can add streaming channels by searching in the Roku Channel Store. New 
streaming channels are added to the bottom of the Home screen. If you want to move 
the channel tile to a different position in the grid, see Rearrange tiles. 
		 	
85 
	 	
	  
Rename inputs 
Rather than trying to remember that your Blu-ray™ player is connected to HDMI 1 and 
your game console is connected to HDMI 3, you can rename the TV inputs to match 
the connected component. 
Note: Renaming an input also changes the icon associated with it. 
To rename an input, you can either: 
•  Highlight the input tile in the Home screen, and then press Þ to display a list of 
options. From the list of options, select Rename input. Then select a new name 
and icon. 
or 
•  From the Home screen, navigate to Settings > TV inputs. On the TV inputs screen, 
select the input you want to rename, select Rename, and then choose a new 
name and icon from the provided list. 
Rather than using the predefined names and icons, you can set a custom name and 
icon. To do so, scroll up or down to highlight Set custom name & icon, and then press 
OK. Follow the instructions on the screen to enter a name and select an icon for the 
input. 
Press   to return to the Home screen. The new name and icon are now in effect. 
	 	
86 
	 	
   
Remove unwanted tiles 
It’s easy to remove unused TV inputs and unwanted channel or app tiles. For example, 
if you never use the HDMI 3 input, or if you don’t like the weather app you added from 
the Roku Channel Store, you can remove them from your Home screen.  
Note: You also can remove the Antenna TV tile if you never use the TV tuner. But be 
aware that removing the Antenna TV tile also deletes the channel list. You’ll have to 
set up the TV tuner again next time you want to view Antenna TV. Instructions for 
setting up the TV tuner can be found in Setting up Antenna TV. 
•  To remove any tile, highlight the input tile in the Home screen, and then press 
Þ to display a list of options. From the list of options, select Remove input. In the 
screen that follows, confirm you want to remove the input. 
•  Alternatively, to remove a TV input tile from the Home screen, navigate to 
Settings > TV inputs. On the TV inputs screen, select the input you want to 
remove, and then select Remove > Confirm. Then press   to return to the Home 
screen. 
		 	
87 
	 	
	  
Rearrange tiles 
When you add a TV input tile, it’s added at the top of your Home screen. When you 
add a new streaming channel, it’s added at the bottom of your Home screen. 
You can easily rearrange the order of the tiles on the Home screen to suit your 
viewing preferences. For example, you might want Antenna TV to be the first tile in 
your Home screen. But if you mostly watch one streaming channel, you might want its 
tile to be the first one on your Home screen. 
1.  From the Home screen, highlight one of the tiles you want to move.  
2.  Press Þ to display a list of options for the type of tile you selected. 
3.  Select Move input or Move channel. The list of options disappears and the 
highlighted tile shows arrows indicating how it can be moved. 
 
Note: A paid subscription or other payments may be required for some 
channels. Channel availability is subject to change and varies by country. Not all 
content is available in countries or regions where Roku® products are sold. 
4.  Use the arrow keys to move the highlighted tile to its new position. As you 
move the tile, it pushes other tiles out of its way. 
5.  Press OK to lock the tile into its new position. 
	 	
88 
	 	
   
6.  Repeat these steps to move other tiles until you have arranged your Home 
screen to your liking. 
Change themes 
Only in connected mode, another way to customize your TV is to change its theme. 
The theme establishes the look and feel of the TV through colors, designs, and fonts. 
Some themes require payment. 
To change the theme, in the Home screen menu navigate to Settings > Themes. In the 
Themes screen, choose from the following options: 
•  My themes – Highlight a theme, and then press OK to switch to that theme.  
•  Get more themes – Highlight this option at the bottom of the My Themes list, and 
then press OK to shop for new themes. 
•  Custom settings – Turn Featured themes on or off. When Featured themes is on, the 
TV automatically switches to featured themes—like certain holiday-inspired 
themes —for a limited time whenever Roku makes them available, and then 
switches back to your selected theme when the featured theme expires. When 
off, the TV uses your selected theme. 
Edit Antenna TV channel lineup 
When you set up the TV tuner as described in Setting up Antenna TV, the TV adds all 
the channels with good signals that it can detect in your area. It’s likely that you now 
have more channels than you want in your channel list.  
To edit the channel lineup, from the Home screen, navigate to Settings > TV inputs > 
Antenna TV > Edit channel lineup. You’ll see a screen listing all of your channels. Adjacent 
to the list of channels is a miniature TV screen playing the highlighted channel’s 
picture and sound. 
		 	
89 
	 	
	  
 
Highlight each channel you want to hide, and then press OK to hide the channel.  
Tip: If you need to see or hear the highlighted channel, wait a couple of seconds for 
the TV to start playing the channel’s picture and sound. Also note that if you’ve 
enabled parental controls and the program on the current channel is blocked, you 
won’t see a picture or hear sound while editing the channel lineup.  
Note: Repeating the tuner channel scan unhides all hidden channels. 
Change sound effects volume 
Sound effects are the noises the TV makes to let you know it received your command. 
You can change the volume of sound effects or turn them off. 
To adjust the sound effects volume, in the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > 
Audio > Menu volume. Navigate to the right and then change the setting to High, 
Medium, Low, or Off. 
	 	
90 
	 	
   
Configure power settings 
Power settings let you configure features related to how your TV’s power settings 
work. 
Power on settings 
Power on settings tell the TV what to do when you turn on the power. To configure 
the power on settings, from the Home screen, navigate to Settings > System > Power > 
Power on. Highlight the preferred power on location in the list, and then press OK.  
 
Auto power savings 
To help you save energy, your TV can automatically turn itself off after a period of 
inactivity or a period during which no signal has been detected. It is factory-
configured to do both of these things, but you can change these settings if needed. 
To configure automatic power off, from the Home screen menu navigate to Settings > 
System > Power > Auto power savings. In the Power settings screen, highlight the following 
options and press OK to turn them on or off: 
		 	
91 
	 	
	  
•  Reduce power after 15 minutes – If no video or audio activity and no user 
interaction occur for 15 minutes, the TV automatically turns off the screen and 
sound.  
•  Turn off after 4 hours – If no video or audio activity and no user interaction occur 
for 4 hours, the TV goes into standby mode. 
Standby LED On/Off 
Normally, the status LED on the front of your TV is lit whenever the TV is in standby 
mode. If you prefer the status LED to not be lit in standby mode, you can turn it off. 
To do so, from the Home screen, navigate to Settings > System > Power > Standby LED, 
and then select Off. 
After making this change, the status LED still performs all other indication functions. 
Fast TV start 
Only in connected mode on TV models that are not Energy Star certified, you can 
enable Fast TV start. As you might expect, Fast TV start lets you start watching your TV 
almost instantly after turning it on. But it also enables other convenient features, such 
as the ability to turn on your TV using voice commands or the Roku mobile app. 
Be aware that enabling Fast TV start makes your TV use somewhat more power when 
it is powered off to standby mode. 
Configure accessibility (U.S. only) 
Accessibility settings enable users with vision or hearing impairment to use the TV 
more effectively. Accessibility settings are located under Settings > Accessibility. 
Captions mode 
The Captions mode settings specify when closed captions appear. Access caption 
settings from the Home screen by selecting Settings > Accessibility > Captions mode. At 
this point, you can choose among the following options: 
	 	
92 
	 	
   
•  Off – No captions appear. 
•  On always– Captions appear whenever they are available from the program 
source. 
•  On replay– Captions appear only when you use the replay feature, and only 
when you are watching a streaming program that supports instant replay or 
watching a TV channel after enabling Live TV Pause. 
•  On mute – Captions appear only when the TV is muted. 
Tips:  
•  You can change the captions mode while watching a program. Press Þ to 
display the Options menu, and then select Closed Captioning. 
•  Some streaming channels require you to enable captions through a setting 
within their channel even though you have turned on captions in the TV 
settings. 
Note: Once enabled, the selected captions mode applies to all inputs that support 
captions and remains enabled until you turn it off. 
Captions preferred language 
The Captions preferred language setting lets you select the language in which you want 
closed captioning to appear, when that language is available. If your preferred 
language is not available, then captioning reverts to the default language for the 
program, which usually is English.  
Highlight the language you prefer, and then press OK to select it. 
Captions style 
The Captions style settings let you control how closed captions look when displayed on 
your TV. Access caption style settings from the Home screen by selecting  Settings > 
Accessibility > Captions style. At this point, you can choose among the following options: 
		 	
93 
	 	
	  
•  Text style – Choose from a list of fonts. As you move the highlight to each font, 
you can see a sample of the result in an adjacent panel.

each setting, you can see a sample of the result in an adjacent panel. 
•  Background color - Choose from a list of colors for the background area behind 
the text. As you move the highlight to each color, you can see a sample of the 
result in an adjacent panel. Note that you won’t see any change unless you set 
the Background opacity to a value other than Off. 
•  Background opacity - Choose from a list of opacity settings for the background 
of the caption. This setting determines how much the area behind the caption 
background shows through the background. A value of 100% blocks all of the 
content behind the background. As you move the highlight to each setting, you 
can see a sample of the result in an adjacent panel. 
•  Window color - Choose from a list of colors for the window rectangle 
surrounding the entire caption. As you move the highlight to each color, you 
can see a sample of the result in an adjacent panel. Note that you won’t see any 
change unless you set the Window opacity to a value other than Default or Off. 
•  Window opacity - Choose from a list of opacity settings for the window rectangle 
surrounding the entire caption. This setting determines how much the area 
	 	
94 
	 	
   
behind the caption window shows through the window. A value of 100% blocks 
all of the content behind the window. As you move the highlight to each 
setting, you can see a sample of the result in an adjacent panel. 
Audio Guide settings 
Audio Guide settings help users who are blind or visually impaired to configure the 
text-to-speech reader, enabling them to operate their TV more easily. Audio Guide 
uses voice prompts that speak volume and channel changes, menu options, and 
setting changes. Access Audio Guide settings from the Home screen by navigating to 
Settings > Accessibility, and then select from the following options in the Audio Guide 
section: 
•  Audio Guide – Turn Audio Guide on or off. 
•  Speech rate – Select one of four speeds at which to hear spoken guide 
information: Slow, Normal, Fast, or Very Fast. 
•  Volume – Select the volume at which to hear spoken guide information, relative 
to the main TV volume. 
•  Shortcut – Enable or disable the shortcut feature. When enabled (the default), 
pressing Þ four times in quick succession enables or disables the Audio Guide. 
		 	
95 
	 	
	  
Changing caption settings (Canada only) 
On models sold in the United States, you can find caption settings under Settings > 
Accessibility > Captions mode and Captions style. On models sold in Canada, you can find 
captions settings under Settings > Captions. 
Captions mode 
•  Off – No captions appear.

setting, you can see a sample of the result in an adjacent panel. 
Configuring parental controls 
Parental controls enable you to control whether the members of your household can 
view certain kinds of broadcast TV programs. When a program or feature is blocked, 
you can unblock it by entering a parental control PIN that only you know. 
Note: Parental controls block content from the TV tuner and from streaming options, if 
any, on the Home screen menu. Parental controls do not block content on other TV 
inputs or content from streaming channels you add to your TV. 
Creating a parental control PIN 
The first time you access the Parental controls screen, you must create a new parental 
control PIN. Thereafter, whenever you want to change parental control settings, 
unblock programming that has been blocked, change the PIN, or disable parental 
controls, you must enter your parental control PIN. 
Tip: Your parental control PIN has nothing to do with your Roku PIN. You can make 
them the same if you want—this is entirely your choice. 
To create a new parental control PIN, from the Home screen menu navigate to Settings 
> Parental controls. The screen displays a numeric keypad. Use the arrow keys and then 
press OK to enter a four digit code. Then repeat the process to enter the same PIN 
again, just to make sure you correctly entered the PIN you want to use. 
Important: If you forget your parental control PIN, the only way to recover is to 
perform a factory reset operation, as explained in Factory reset everything. Be sure to 
write it down in a safe place just in case. 
	 	
98 
	 	
   
Blocking Movie Store, TV Store, and News (U.S. only) 
One of the parental control options is to completely hide the entertainment options 
that are available directly on the Home screen menu. 
To hide Home screen entertainment options: 
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Parental controls, and then 
enter your parental control PIN.  
2.  In the Parental controls screen, highlight Home screen and then select or clear 
either of these options: 
•  Hide “Movie Store and TV Store” – Removes the Movie Store and TV Store 
options from the Home screen menu. 
•  Hide “News” – Removes the News option from the Home screen menu. 
Tip: To use either of these options after you’ve hidden them, you must return to this 
screen and remove the check mark from the corresponding Hide command. 
Blocking Broadcast TV shows 
For broadcast TV, parental controls use information embedded in the broadcast 
signal to determine whether to allow a program to be displayed. Parents can 
configure parental controls to block broadcast TV programs that meet or exceed a 
specific rating, so they cannot be viewed or heard unless the correct parental control 
PIN is entered. 
Note: Rating standards differ by country. 
Enabling parental control of TV shows 
The first step in blocking TV shows is to enable parental control of TV shows.  
This setting is provided separately to make it easier for you to turn parental control of 
TV shows on and off without disturbing their settings. For example, your kids are 
going to summer camp for two weeks, and while they are gone, you don’t want to 
		 	
99 
	 	
	  
have to deal with unblocking shows that you want to watch by entering your parental 
control PIN. All you need to do is clear Enable parental controls, and all TV shows are 
unblocked. When the kids return, select Enable parental controls again, and all of your 
parental control settings are restored in a single operation. 
To enable parental control of TV shows: 
1.  In the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Parental controls, and then enter 
your parental control PIN.  
2.  In the Parental controls screen, navigate to TV tuner > Parental control of TV shows.  
3.  Make sure the check box next to Enable parental controls is checked. If not, 
highlight it and press OK. 
Blocking based on US TV ratings 
Most broadcast US TV shows—other than movies—contain rating data that enables 
parental controls to block shows that parents don’t want others to view. The ratings 
are divided into two groups that function independently: 
•  Youth group – TV-Y, TV-Y7 
•  Main group – TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA 
Within each of these groups, the ratings interact such that if you block a particular 
level of content, the TV also blocks all content with a higher rating. Conversely, if you 
unblock a particular level of content, the TV also unblocks all content with a lower 
rating. For example, if you block TV-PG programs, the TV also blocks TV-14 and TV-
MA programs. If you subsequently unblock TV-14 programs, TV-PG programs are also 
unblocked, but TV-MA programs remain blocked. 
Similarly, within the main group, content types can be individually blocked. For 
example, you can block just coarse language in shows with a TV-PG rating. If you do, 
then the TV also blocks shows with coarse language in the higher ratings (TV-14 and 
TV-MA). Subsequently unblocking coarse language in TV-14 ratings does not unblock 
coarse language in TV-MA programs, but it does unblock coarse language in TV-PG 
programs. 
	 	
100 
	 	
   
To block TV shows based on US television ratings:  
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Parental controls, and then 
enter your parental control PIN.  
2.  In the Parental controls screen, navigate to TV tuner > TV ratings. Choose among 
the following settings: 
•  Entire ratings – Highlight the rating you want to block, and then navigate to 
the right and select the first option that blocks the entire rating level (and 
all higher rating levels). 
•  Individual content types – Highlight the rating that contains the content type 
you want to block, and then select the content types you want to block 
from among those listed. Remember that blocking a content type in one 
rating blocks the equivalent content type in all higher rating levels. 
Blocking based on US movie ratings 
Most movies in the US are rated by the Motion Picture Association of America, or 
MPAA, so the ratings are known as MPAA ratings. TV broadcast signals carry movie 
rating data that enables parental controls to block shows that parents don’t want 
others to see. The ratings are: 
•  G – General audiences 
•  PG – Parental guidance suggested 
•  PG-13 – Parents strongly cautioned for children age 13 or younger 
•  R – Restricted 
•  NC-17 – Not for age 17 or younger 
Unlike US TV ratings, there are no individual content types within the ratings. But like 
TV ratings, blocking movies with a particular rating also blocks movies with a higher 
rating, and unblocking movies with a particular rating also unblocks movies with a 
lower rating. 
Tip: Blocking movies with an NC-17 rating also blocks programs with the now-obsolete 
X rating, which can still occur in the program data of older movies. 
		 	
101 
	 	
	  
To block movies based on MPAA ratings:  
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Parental controls, and then 
enter your parental control PIN.  
2.  In the Parental controls screen, navigate to TV Tuner > Movie ratings.  
3.  Select the rating level you want to block. You need only select one rating level, 
and all higher levels are automatically blocked. 
Blocking based on Other ratings 
Your TV can block programs having ratings that had not been defined when the TV 
was manufactured. It does this by detecting a new Rating Region Table in a program 
and then downloading the new table and displaying its rating in the Parental controls. 
When the TV downloads a new Rating Region Table, it adds a new option to the list 
of rating types: Other ratings. If you see this option in the Parental controls screen, you 
have tuned to a station that has implemented a new rating table. Once the new rating 
table has been downloaded to the TV, it remains in the TV until it is factory reset, and 
you can configure blocking based on the new ratings. 
New Region Rating Tables can have independent rating levels, or rating levels that 
interact in the same ways as the built-in US TV and MPAA Movie ratings.  
Tip: If your TV downloads a new Region Rating Table, you’ll have to experiment with 
its settings to understand how to use it. 
Blocking based on Canadian English ratings 
Canadian-English language and third-language programs that are broadcast in 
Canada are rated by the Action Group on Violence on Television, or AGVOT. TV 
broadcast signals carry rating data that enables parental controls to block shows that 
parents don’t want others to view based on content containing violence, language, 
sex, or nudity. The ratings are: 
•  C – Children under 8 years 
•  C8 – Children 8 years and older 
	 	
102 
	 	
   
•  G – Generally suitable for all age groups 
•  PG – Parental guidance suggested for viewers under 14 years 
•  14+ – Generally not suitable for viewers under 14 years 
•  18+ – Generally not suitable for viewers under 18 years 
Blocking content with a particular rating also blocks content with a higher rating, and 
unblocking content with a particular rating also unblocks movies with a lower rating. 
To block programs based on AGVOT ratings:  
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Parental controls, and then 
enter your parental control PIN.  
2.  In the Parental controls screen, navigate to TV tuner > Canadian English ratings.  
3.  Select the rating level you want to block. You need only select one rating level, 
and all higher levels are automatically blocked. 
Blocking based on Canadian French ratings 
Canadian-French language programs that are broadcast in Canada are rated by the 
Régie du cinéma du Québec. TV broadcast signals carry rating data that enables 
parental controls to block shows that parents don’t want others to view based on 
content containing violence, language, sex, or nudity. The ratings are: 
•  G – Generally suitable for all age groups 
•  8+ – Viewers 8 years and older 
•  13+ – Viewers 13 years and older 
•  16+ – Viewers 16 years and older 
•  18+ – Adults only 
Blocking content with a particular rating also blocks content with a higher rating, and 
unblocking content with a particular rating also unblocks movies with a lower rating. 
To block programs based on Canadian-French ratings:  
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Parental controls, and then 
enter your parental control PIN.  
		 	
103 
	 	
	  
2.  In the Parental controls screen, navigate to TV tuner > Canadian French ratings.  
3.  Select the rating level you want to block. You need only select one rating level, 
and all higher levels are automatically blocked. 
Blocking unrated programs 
Some broadcast TV shows and movies are assigned a rating of “Unrated”. Whether or 
not such programs contain content that is objectionable to you cannot be 
determined. However, you can choose to block such programs. 
To block all unrated broadcasts:  
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Parental controls, and then 
enter your parental control PIN.  
2.  In the Parental controls screen, navigate to TV tuner > Block all unrated programs.  
3.  Highlight Unrated programs and press OK. When blocking is enabled, the 
adjacent padlock icon changes from unlocked to locked. 
Tip: Blocking programs that have been assigned a rating of “Unrated” does not block 
programs that have no rating assigned to them (for example a broadcast of a local 
town council meeting). Programs that do not have an assigned rating display Rating 
NA (for “not applicable,” meaning a rating is not needed).

What happens when a TV show is blocked? 
After you’ve set up parental controls, TV shows and movies can be blocked: 
•  When you change channels and the new channel is playing a program whose 
rating exceeds your settings. 
•  When a new show comes on the channel you are watching and its rating 
exceeds your settings. 
When a program is blocked by parental control settings, the TV displays a blocked 
message: 
 
Whenever this blocked message appears, both the video and audio of the show are 
blocked, as well as program data that would normally appear in the area at the 
bottom of the screen. 
		 	
105 
	 	
	  
To watch the blocked program, you need to know the PIN code defined when you 
enabled parental controls, as explained in Creating a parental control PIN. 
1.  Press OK to select Unblock and display a PIN pad. 
 
2.  Use the arrow keys to enter your parental control PIN code, and then press OK 
to select Unblock everything. 
After unblocking shows that have been blocked, all blocking is disabled for two hours 
or until you turn off the TV. 
Changing the parental control PIN 
To change your parental control PIN: 
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Parental controls, and then 
enter your parental control PIN.  
2.  In the Parental controls screen, highlight Change PIN.  
3.  Move the highlight into the adjacent keypad, and then use the arrow keys and 
then press OK  to enter a four digit code. Then repeat the process to enter the 
same PIN again, just to make sure you correctly entered the PIN you want to 
use. 
	 	
106 
	 	
   
Resetting parental controls 
So now your kids have grown up and gone away to college, and you no longer want 
to deal with blocked programs.  
To erase all parental control settings: 
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > Parental controls, and then 
enter your parental control PIN.  
2.  In the Parental controls screen, highlight Reset parental controls.  
3.  Follow the instructions on the screen to confirm that you want to erase all 
parental control settings. 
Tip: Resetting parental controls also erases your parental control PIN.

More settings 
This section describes the features and settings of the TV that were not covered in 
the other parts of this guide. 
Changing network settings 
If needed, you can change your network settings at any time. For example, if you 
change the name of your wireless network (its SSID) or its password, you will need to 
change your TV’s settings so that it can continue to connect. Also, if you decided not 
to connect to the Internet in Guided Setup, you can use network settings to connect 
at a later time. 
To change network settings, from the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > 
Network, and then press the RIGHT arrow. At this point, you can choose the following 
options: 
•  About – Lists important information about your current network connection, 
such as status, connection type, IP addresses, and MAC address. This 
information is often useful when contacting customer support with connection 
issues. 
•  Check connection – Select your existing network connection type, and then 
press OK to start checking the network connect. The TV uses your current 
network information to reconfirm the wireless or wired network connection to 
the local network and the Internet connection. 
•  Set up connection – Select a network connection type, and then select the option 
to set up a new connection. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the 
network connection. For help with each of the steps, see Network connection. 
	 	
108 
	 	
   
Note: Some networks, such as those found in dorm rooms, hotels, and other public 
places, may require you to read and agree to terms, enter a code, or provide 
identifying information before letting you connect to the Internet. For more 
information, see Using your TV in a hotel or dorm room.  
Changing time settings 
You can change time settings to suit your preferences. You can find the following 
settings by navigating from the Home screen menu to Settings > System > Time: 
•  Sleep timer – Set a time delay after which the TV will automatically shut off. This 
setting reflects the setting you can make in the Options menu from any TV 
input, as explained in Options menu settings. Note that the sleep timer setting 
is not input specific. 
•  Time zone – Select whether to set the time zone automatically or manually, and 
if set manually, select your current time zone. Typically, a TV connected to the 
Internet can discover its own time zone automatically, and a TV that is not 
connected to the Internet must be set manually. Initially, this setting is made 
when you set up the TV tuner, as explained in Setting up Antenna TV. Correct 
time zone information is needed to correctly display program data.  
•  Clock format – Select whether to display time in a 12-hour or 24-hour format, or 
to turn off time display. This setting is available only on TVs that are connected 
to the Internet. Non-connected TVs do not display the time. 
		 	
109 
	 	
	  
Scanning for Antenna TV channels again 
There will be times when you need to create a new channel list. For example, you: 
•  Change cable providers  
•  Reorient your TV antenna 
•  Move to a different city with different channels 
Whenever you need to update your TV channel list, you can repeat the channel scan. 
Tip: Repeat the channel scan from time to time to make sure you are receiving all of 
the latest channels. Broadcasters add and remove channels, move channels to 
different parts of the spectrum, and change the power levels of their channels 
periodically.  
Note: Repeating the tuner channel scan removes your favorite selections and unhides 
all hidden channels. 
To repeat the channel scan, from the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > TV 
inputs > Antenna TV > Scan again for channels. Then select Start finding channels to begin 
the channel scan process. The screens and options that appear during this process 
are identical to those described in How do I set up the TV tuner? 
Setting the HDMI® mode (4K models only) 
On 4K (UHD) TVs, you can independently configure each HDMI® input to match the 
capabilities of the connected device. From the Home screen menu, navigate to 
	 	
110 
	 	
   
Settings > TV inputs, and then select an enabled HDMI® input. Next, select HDMI mode 
and then select one of the following settings: 
•  Auto – Let the TV determine the best setting. Use this option unless your HDMI® 
device does not correctly communicate its HDMI® version compatibility. 
•  HDMI 1.4 – Configure the input for compatibility with HDMI® version 1.4, which 
supports a maximum refresh rate of 30 Hz at full UHD resolution. Most HDMI® 
devices will work correctly with the TV in this mode. 
•  HDMI 2.0 – Configure the input for compatibility with HDMI® version 2.0, which 
supports a maximum refresh rate of 60 Hz at full UHD resolution. You must use 
this mode to view HDR content from the device connected to this HDMI® input. 
However, note that many older HDMI® devices do not work correctly when the 
TV’s HDMI® input is set to this mode. 
Adjusting external control 
You can choose the level of external control you want to allow your TV to accept. 
External control enables other devices, including the Roku Mobile App, to control your 
TV over the local area network in your home.  
To adjust the level of external control access: 
1.  From the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > System > Advanced system 
settings > External control. 
2.  Select Network access.  
3.  Choose one of the following settings: 
•  Default – External control is enabled only on a private network address, and 
accepts commands only from other private network addresses on your 
		 	
111 
	 	
	  
home network. This setting is suitable for most cases, including use of the 
Roku mobile app on your smartphone.  
•  Permissive – External control is enabled under all conditions, but accepts 
commands only from private network addresses or the same subnetwork 
within your home network. This setting might be required when attempting 
to operate the TV from a third-party application, for example, one of the 
Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as ifttt.com. 
•  Disabled – External control is completely disabled. The TV does not accept 
external commands from any source, including the Roku mobile app. 
Using the TV in a home theater 
Your TV has several features that make it an ideal TV for a home theater. But you 
might not notice them because they remain in the background until you decide to use 
them. 
Turning off the speakers 
When you use your TV with a sound bar or an external amplifier and speakers, you’ll 
probably want to turn off the internal TV speakers.  
To turn off the TV’s built-in speakers, in the Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > 
Audio > TV speakers and change the setting. 
Tip: The TV’s internal speakers can be enabled and disabled automatically as needed 
by system audio control, as described in Enable system audio control. Using the 
headphone jack also turns off the internal speakers. 
	 	
112 
	 	
   
Changing the audio mode 
The TV has two audio modes, accessed by navigating in the Home screen menu to 
Settings >Audio > Audio mode:  
•  Stereo – Use this setting for internal speakers, headphones, and external stereo 
amplifiers connected through HDMI® ARC, SPDIF optical, or headphone jack. 
•  Auto – Use this setting to automatically detect the best audio setting based on 
the audio stream in the content you are watching. If you have connected the 
TV to an external Dolby Audio™ compatible amplifier, receiver, or sound bar 
through HDMI® ARC or SPDIF optical, the TV automatically selects the 
appropriate surround sound capabilities of the device based on the 
characteristics of the current program. 
		 	
113 
	 	
	  
Setting up a digital audio connection 
You can connect the TV to an external amplifier, receiver, or sound bar by using either 
of these two connections: 
•  HDMI ARC – The HDMI® Audio Return Channel enables the TV to output 
digital audio on one of its HDMI® connectors. The connected amplifier 
can also function simultaneously as an input source to the TV, if 
needed. To use the ARC capability, you must connect an HDMI® cable from 
your amplifier’s HDMI® ARC connector to the HDMI ARC connector on the TV. 
You also must: 
o  Be sure your HDMI® cable is certified by HDMI®. 
o  Enable HDMI ARC under Settings > System > Control other devices (CEC), as 
explained in Enable HDMI® ARC. 
•  SPDIF optical – The TV has an SPDIF optical connector that outputs a 
digital audio signal. To use the optical output, connect a TOSLINK 
optical cable from the amplifier to the Optical or SPDIF connector on 
the TV.  
Note: Dolby Audio™ supporting Dolby Digital Plus™ format is not available 
through the SPDIF optical output. This format is only available through the 
HDMI® ARC connection. 
After making the required HDMI® ARC or SPDIF optical connection, go to Settings > 
Audio > S/PDIF and ARC option and select the audio format to use.  
Note: In most cases, Auto detect is the best option. Other settings can result in no sound 
when the content you are viewing does not contain the audio stream type you 
selected. 
	 	
114 
	 	
   
Controlling other devices through CEC 
Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) enables your TV and other CEC-compatible 
home entertainment components to control one another in various ways. First, the 
CEC-compatible devices must “discover” one another and report their capabilities. 
After this, one device can control another according to the features you enable. For 
example, playing a disc on a Blu-ray™ player could switch the TV to the Blu-ray™ 
player’s input. Or, powering off the TV could also power off the Blu-ray™ player and 
the home theater receiver. 
Discover connected CEC devices 
To discover CEC devices: 
1.  Make sure that your CEC-compatible components are connected to the TV 
with a suitable High Speed HDMI® Cable that supports HDMI® ARC and CEC 
control. 
2.  Turn on each component and make sure all components are CEC enabled. 
Tip: Some manufacturers have their own branded names for CEC functionality, 
so you might need to read the product documentation to correctly identify the 
CEC features of the device. 
3.  On the TV’s Home screen menu, navigate to Settings > System > Control other 
devices (CEC) and then select Search for CEC devices. Press OK to repeat the 
discovery process, if necessary.  
When finished, the TV displays a list of CEC devices that are connected to each HDMI® 
input, as well as any devices that had previously been connected. The TV remembers 
the names of multiple CEC devices even when they are no longer connected. If the list 
is longer than the allowed space, press Þ to see a complete list in a scrollable window. 
Enable HDMI® ARC 
HDMI® ARC is the audio return channel that is available on one of the TV’s HDMI® ports. 
The audio return channel enables you to send a Dolby Audio™ signal back to a home 
		 	
115 
	 	
	  
theater receiver that is also sending an audio and video signal into the TV. Using 
HDMI® ARC reduces the number of cables needed and optionally lets you control the 
volume and mute state of the receiver by enabling system audio control. 
HDMI® ARC is disabled by default. To enable HDMI® ARC, in the Home screen menu, 
navigate to Settings > System > Control other devices (CEC), and then highlight HDMI 
ARC. Press OK to enable or disable the feature. 
Note: Enabling HDMI ARC also enables System audio control. After enabling HDMI ARC, 
you can disable System audio control if you prefer. 
Enable system audio control 
System audio control enables the TV remote control to change the volume and mute 
state of an amplifier or sound bar connected through HDMI®, and to display the 
external device’s volume and mute status in the TV’s on-screen display.  
The TV automatically turns off its internal speakers and sends volume and mute 
control signals to an external amplifier when all of the following are true: 
•  System audio control is enabled on the TV. 
•  The TV is connected to a CEC-compatible amplifier, it is powered on, and CEC 
discoverability is enabled. 
•  The CEC-compatible amplifier’s HDMI® ARC connector is connected to the TV’s 
HDMI ARC connector with a suitable HDMI® cable. 
When the CEC-compatible amplifier is off, the TV automatically turns on its speakers 
(unless you have turned them off as described in Turning off the speakers) and 
resumes local control of volume and mute state. 
To enable or disable system audio control, in the Home screen menu, navigate to 
Settings > System > Control other devices (CEC) and highlight System audio control. Press 
OK to enable or disable the feature. 
	 	
116 
	 	
   
Enable 1-touch play 
1-touch play enables a component to control which TV input is active. For example, 
pressing Play on your Blu-ray™ player switches the TV to the Blu-ray™ input.  
1-touch play is disabled by default. To enable 1-touch play, in the Home screen menu, 
navigate to Settings > System > Control other devices (CEC) and highlight 1-touch play. 
Press OK to enable or disable the feature. 
Enable system standby 
The system standby feature causes other components to power off when you power 
off your TV. Depending on the CEC System Standby implementation, it also might 
enable connected components to power off your TV when you power off the 
component. 
System standby is disabled by default. To enable system standby, in the Home screen 
menu, navigate to Settings > System > Control other devices (CEC) and highlight System 
standby. Press OK to enable or disable the feature. 
Restarting the TV 
You can restart the TV when necessary. Restarting has the same effect as unplugging 
the TV power and then plugging it in again. 
To restart the TV, navigate to Settings > System > Power, and then select System restart. 
Highlight Restart, and then press OK to confirm restart.  
While the TV restarts, the screen goes dark for a few seconds, and then displays the 
startup screen for a few more seconds. When the restart operation completes, the TV 
displays the activity you selected in Power on settings. 
		 	
117 
	 	
	  
Resetting the TV 
You can choose to reset only the TV picture and audio settings to their original 
values, or perform a full factory reset to return the TV to the state it was in when you 
first unpacked and turned it on. 
Reset audio/video settings 
To reset only the TV picture and audio settings to their original values, navigate to 
Settings > System > Advanced system settings > Factory reset, and then highlight Reset TV 
audio/video settings. Read the information on the screen to make sure you understand 
what the reset operation does. 
To proceed with the reset operation, press PLAY/PAUSE three times in a row. 
Factory reset everything 
A full factory reset returns the TV’s settings to their original state and removes all 
personally identifiable information from the TV. When finished, you must repeat 
Guided Setup, reconnecting to the Internet, re-linking your Roku account, and 
reloading any streaming channels. You also must repeat Antenna TV setup and input 
configuration.  
Factory reset is the recommended choice if you want to transfer the TV to another 
owner, and it is the only choice if you want to switch from Store mode to Home mode 
(if you inadvertently selected Store mode during Guided Setup). 
To perform a factory reset, navigate to Settings > System > Advanced system settings > 
Factory reset, and then highlight Factory reset everything. Read the information on the 
screen to make sure you understand what this reset operation does.  
To proceed with the full factory reset, use the on-screen number pad to enter the 
code displayed on the screen, and then select OK to proceed.  
When the factory reset operation completes, the TV restarts and displays the first 
Guided Setup screen.

including the name of the connection (its SSID) and your wireless password, if any, 
and then it restarts. After restarting, your TV retains all of its other settings and its 
association with your Roku account.  
After resetting your network connection, navigate from the Home screen to Settings > 
Network > Set up new connection to continue enjoying all of the benefits of your 
connected TV. 
Changing your Roku Channel Store PIN preference 
When you created your Roku account, you were given the opportunity to create a 
PIN code and to specify when it must be used. If you created a Channel Store PIN and 
want to change it, or you don’t remember your PIN, or if you didn’t create a Channel 
Store +PIN and want to add one, you can easily make these changes. 
1.  On a computer, tablet, or smartphone, use your web browser to go to 
https://my.roku.com and sign in. 
After signing in, the My Account page appears. 
2.  Under PIN Preference, click Update to open the Choose Your PIN Preferences page. 
3.  Skip this step if you just want to change your PIN. Otherwise, choose the 
option your prefer from among those listed: 
•  Require a PIN to make purchases or to add any item from the Channel 
Store. 
•  Require a PIN to make purchases. 
		 	
119 
	 	
	  
•  Do not require a PIN to make purchases. 
4.  If you choose either of the first two options, enter your PIN twice in the 
appropriate boxes.  
5.  Click Save Changes to save your changes and return to the My Account page. 
Note that your current setting is described under PIN Preference. 
Getting system updates 
If your TV is operating in connected mode, it will automatically get updates from time 
to time. You don’t need to do anything. But if you are aware that an update is 
available and you don’t want to wait until the TV updates itself, you can manually 
check for updates. 
If your TV is operating in non-connected mode, you can still get updates by using a 
USB flash drive. 
You can download an updated User Guide that matches your TCL • Roku TV software 
version from the Roku web site at:  
www.roku.com/support 
To determine your current TCL • Roku TV software version, go to Settings > System > 
About, and then press OK or navigate to the right. 
Checking for updates on a connected TV 
If you’re one of those people who has to have the latest, most up-to-date features the 
moment they are available, you can check for updates as often as you want. 
To check for updates, navigate to Settings > System > System update, and then select 
Check now. The TV responds either with a message saying that your TV is up to date, 
or with a message saying that an update is available.  
Follow the instructions on the screen to install the system update. 
	 	
120 
	 	
   
Note: Sometimes system updates install new system software, and other times they 
install new features for streaming channels. Therefore, you won’t always see a change 
in the behavior of your TV after a system update. 
Getting updates on a non-connected TV 
If your TV is not connected to the Internet, you can still get system updates by using 
a USB flash drive and a computer with an Internet connection. 
To get a system update, navigate to Settings > System > System update: 
 
The System update screen on a non-connected TV gives you the opportunity to 
connect your TV to the Internet to automatically receive updates. We recommend 
this option if it is possible in your situation. To proceed, select Connect to the Internet 
and follow the instructions in What if I didn’t connect my TV?. 
		 	
121 
	 	
	  
Otherwise, if you can’t connect to the Internet, select I can’t connect, and then follow 
the instructions on the screen. Here’s a summary: 
1.  On an Internet-connected computer, go to the web site displayed on the 
System update screen.  
2.  On the USB Update web page, select the correct brand and model, and then 
click Next.  
3.  Click Download Software, and then save the file to the root folder of a standard 
USB flash drive.  
 
USB flash drive 
Any normal USB flash drive will work, provided it has a FAT-16 or FAT-32 file system 
format. (This is the default for most flash drives.)  
The size of the download is small—usually less than 100 MB—and so will fit on most any 
size flash drive you might have. 
 
4.  When the download finishes, take the USB flash drive to the TV and plug it into 
the USB port. When you do, the TV validates the files on the flash drive and 
displays a 12-digit code.  
5.  Write down the code and the web address, and take this information back to 
your Internet-connected computer.  
6.  On the 12-digit code page, enter the code your TV displayed, and then click Next.  
7.  On the 6-digit code page, write down the 6-digit code that appears, and then 
take it back to your TV. 
	 	
122 
	 	
   
 
12- and 6-digit codes 
The USB update process uses a pair of codes to validate that you are authorized to 
install an update, and to ensure you are not attempting to install an old, unsupported 
version of the system software. 
 
8.  Using the TV remote control, select Next to move to the next screen, and then 
use the on-screen keyboard to enter the 6-digit code. When finished, select OK. 
The system update begins. Do not remove the USB flash drive until the TV

IMPORTANT: READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU USE A TCL • ROKU TV. ALSO REVIEW THE 
IMPORTANT PRODUCT INFORMATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH YOUR TCL • ROKU TV. 
Overview 
This End User License Agreement (“EULA”) between you and Roku, Inc. (“Roku”) governs the use of: (a) your television 
which uses the Roku platform to play digital content over the Internet (“Television”), and (b) any firmware and 
software that have been pre-installed on the Television and the firmware and software updates Roku provides to you 
for the Television (collectively, the “Software”). By linking the Television to your account on Roku’s website (“Roku 
Account”) or using the Television, you are agreeing to this EULA. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, 
by agreeing to this EULA, you expressly agree to waive your right to withdraw. 
		 	
133 
	 	
	  
If you do not agree to this EULA, you do not have the right to use the Television or the Software. If you are within the 
allowable time period for returns under the applicable return policy, you may return the Television to your seller for a 
refund, subject to the terms of such return policy. You should perform a factory reset before you return it to erase 
data that may be stored on the Television. For instructions on how to reset your Television, please visit 
www.roku.com/support. 
In this EULA, “Channel” means an application in the Roku Channel Store; “Content” means movies, television shows, 
music and other audio and visual materials and entertainment; “Content Provider” means any provider of Content; and 
“Roku Channel Store” means the storefront of applications provided by Roku via the Television’s on-screen menu. 
Changes to This EULA 
Roku may amend this EULA at any time in its discretion. Such amendments shall be effective immediately upon 
posting of the amended EULA on Roku’s website or via the Television or your Roku Account, whichever occurs first. If 
you have a Roku Account that is linked to your Television, then in its option, Roku may also notify you of the amended 
EULA by sending a notice to the last email address you have provided to Roku. You agree to provide accurate and 
complete information if and when you set up your Roku Account, and you agree to promptly update your account 
information (including contact information) to keep it accurate and complete. You can do this at any time by signing 
in to your Roku Account. Following such posting or notice by any of the methods described above, continued use of 
your Television or Roku Account means you accept and agree to the amended EULA. If you do not agree to the 
amended EULA, Roku may not be able to provide updates, upgrades or enhancements to your Television, and you 
may not be able to continue using your Television or Roku Account. 
Permitted Use and Restrictions 
The Television and the Software are for personal, non-commercial use only. Copying or redistribution of any Content 
delivered via the Television is strictly prohibited and we may prevent or restrict you from copying or re-distributing 
any elements of the Software or Content using digital rights management or other technologies. The Television and 
the Software are for use only in those countries where the manufacturer of your Television has authorized its sale. If 
you are using the Television and the Software outside of these countries, the rights granted under this EULA do not 
apply. Some of the Content Providers use technologies to verify your geographic location, and you may not be able to 
use the Television or the Software to access any Content outside of the country or location authorized by Roku or the 
Content Provider. Except as expressly provided under this EULA, you do not acquire any intellectual property or other 
proprietary rights in or to the Television, the Software or the Content, including any rights in patents, inventions, 
improvements, designs, trademarks, database rights or copyrights, nor do you acquire any rights in any confidential 
information or trade-secrets. All rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA are reserved by Roku or its 
applicable licensors. You may not remove, obscure, alter or conceal any trademark, logo, copyright or other 
proprietary notice in or on any Television, Software or Content. 
The Software is proprietary to Roku or its third party licensors and may be used only with the Television. Subject to 
this EULA and, where appropriate, the applicable third party licenses, you have a non-exclusive, non-transferable 
license to run the Software and any updated versions provided to you by Roku, only in and as incorporated in the 
Television. This is a license and not a sale. You may not (a) copy, assign, sublicense, lease, sell or rent the Software, 
(b) distribute or otherwise transfer the Software except as incorporated in the Television, provided that, you do not 
retain any copies of the Software and the recipient reads and agrees to this EULA (including all amendments); 
(c) modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of the Software (except only to the extent any of the foregoing 
restriction is prohibited by applicable law or as may be permitted by the license terms governing any Separately 
Licensed Code included with the Software); (d) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise derive source 
code from the Software, except to the extent such actions cannot be prohibited under applicable law because they 
are essential to achieve inter-operability of the Software with another software program, and provided that the 
information obtained by you during such activities is (i) used only to achieve such inter-operability; (ii) not disclosed 
without Roku’s prior written consent; and (iii) not used to create any software that is substantially similar to the

of this EULA.

quality of the service, and as described in Roku’s Privacy Policy. To learn more about voice search, visit the FAQ pages

NO WARRANTY FROM ROKU; Limitation of LIABILITY 
YOUR warranty with respect to the Television is provided by THE TELEVISION’S MANUFACTURER, and not by Roku. 
ROKU OFFERS NO WARRANTY TO YOU UNDER THIS EULA. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE 
FOREGOING DISCLAIMER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: 
(A) THE SEPARATELY LICENSED CODE AND THE SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITH ALL FAULTS 
AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ROKU DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND 
CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ROKU DOES NOT GUARANTEE, 
REPRESENT, OR WARRANT THAT THE TELEVISION, THE SEPARATELY LICENSED CODE AND THE 
SOFTWARE WILL BE: (I) SECURE, VIRUS-FREE OR ERROR-FREE, OR (II) FREE FROM ATTACK OR 
SECURITY INTRUSION. 
(B)  IN NO EVENT SHALL ROKU, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR 
PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, 
INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF ANY TELEVISION, THE 
SEPARATELY LICENSED CODE, THE SOFTWARE, OR YOUR USE THEREOF; AND 
(C)  YOU AGREE THAT (I) THE TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF ROKU, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND 
EMPLOYEES UNDER THIS EULA, INCLUDING LIABIILTY RELATING TO ALL TELEVISIONS LINKED TO YOUR 
ROKU ACCOUNT, AND THE SEPARATELY LICENSED CODE AND THE SOFTWARE IN SUCH TELEVISIONS, 
AND YOUR USE THEREOF, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT SET FORTH IN THE ROKU ACCOUNT 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS YOU AGREED TO FOR YOUR ROKU ACCOUNT, AND (II) ROKU, ITS DIRECTORS, 
OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER THIS EULA FOR ANY DIRECT 
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE TELEVISION. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS 
SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE AND EVEN IF 
ROKU, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
LIABILITY. 
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR LIMITATOINS OF LIABILITY 
FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY 
TO YOU. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT 
APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. 
Export Controls 
You agree not to download any Content or Software, nor otherwise export or re-export any Television or the Software 
into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country as to which the 
United States or your country has embargoed goods, or to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's List of Specially 
Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders or on similar restricted lists 
published by your government from time to time. By using any Television or the Software, you are representing and 
warranting that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any 
such list. 
Choice of Law; Dispute Resolution 
A.  If you are a consumer and a resident in any country in the European Economic Area where the sale of the 
Television is expressly authorized by its manufacturer, this EULA does not apply to you. 
		 	
135 
	 	
	  
B.  In all other cases, including if you are a resident of the United States (and its possessions and territories) or 
Canada, you agree that this EULA shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to 
any conflict of laws principles that may provide the application of the law of another jurisdiction; and: 
1.  You and Roku agree to be bound by the procedures set forth below to resolve any and all claims 
between you and Roku arising out of or relating to any aspect of this EULA, whether based in contract, 
tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, including but not limited to, claims 
between you and Roku related to the Television and the Software. Each such claim is referred to 
individually as “Claim” and collectively as “Claims”. 
2.  You and Roku agree that, except for THE claims identified in paragraph 4 of this section below, any and all CLAIMS 
BETWEEN YOU AND ROKU shall be finally settled by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall take place in 
Santa Clara County, California and shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association 
(“AAA”) pursuant to the AAA’s then-current rules, including (if applicable) the AAA’s Supplementary 
Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. Please be aware there is no judge or jury in arbitration. 
Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than the rules applicable in court, and review of the 
arbitrator’s decision by a court is limited. YOU AND ROKU FURTHER AGREE THAT EACH OF YOU MAY 
BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS 
MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. The arbitrator may 
not consolidate or join more than one person’s claim and may not preside over any consolidated, representative or 
class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive or declaratory relief) only on an 
individual basis and may not award any form of consolidated, representative or class-wide relief. Notwithstanding 
any provision in these terms to the contrary, if the class-action waiver in this provision is deemed invalid 
or unenforceable, or if an arbitration is allowed to proceed on a class basis, then neither you nor Roku 
are entitled to arbitrate the Claims. This arbitration provision is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. 
The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on you and Roku, and may be entered in any court of competent 
jurisdiction. 
3.  Information on AAA and how arbitration is initiated can be found at www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-
7879. For Claims between You and Roku of $75,000 or less, you will be responsible for the initial 
arbitration filing fee, up to the amount of the initial filing fee if you were to initiate a lawsuit against Roku 
based on such Claims in court. If the arbitrator finds such Claims to be non-frivolous, Roku will pay any 
difference in such filing fees plus the arbitrator fees. For Claims between You and Roku in excess of 
$75,000, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to 
the costs of litigation, Roku will pay as much of your actual filing fees and the arbitrator fees for the 
arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as 
compared to the cost of litigation. 
4.  This agreement to arbitrate does not apply to any Claim (a) in which a party is attempting to protect its 
intellectual property rights (such as its patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or moral rights, but 
not including its privacy or publicity rights), or (b) that may be brought in small-claims court. 
5.  If the agreement to arbitrate in this provision is found to be invalid, unenforceable or inapplicable to a 
given Claim between You and Roku, then any and all proceedings to resolve such Claim must be 
brought exclusively in a federal court of competent jurisdiction in the Northern District of California or in 
a state court in Santa Clara County, California. You hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive 
jurisdiction and venue of such courts. 
6.  30-Day Right to Opt Out:  You have the right to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending a written 
notice of your decision to opt out to the following address:  Legal Department, Roku, Inc., 150 
Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, CA  95032, USA; provided that, such notice must be postmarked on or 
before the 30th day after the first to occur of the following events if you do not already have a Roku 
Account: (a) the date of purchase of Your Television, or (b) the date you create your Roku Account. If 
you have an existing Roku Account, all devices you choose to link to your Roku Account, and all services 
provided by Roku which are accessed using these devices, will be subject to this agreement to arbitrate. 
Your notice should include your full name, your current postal address, telephone number and email 
address, the product name and serial number for Your Television, and a copy of the original proof of 
purchase for your Television. If you timely send a notice in compliance with this paragraph 6, the 
agreement to arbitrate will not apply to either you or Roku. If you do not timely send this notice, then 
you agree to be bound by this agreement to arbitrate. 
7.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that, if Roku seeks to delete 
or materially modify the agreement to arbitrate described herein, any such deletion or modification will 
not apply to any individual Claim of which you have notified Roku prior to such modification. 
Miscellaneous 
Roku may transfer its rights and obligations under this EULA to another organization. You may only transfer your 
rights or your obligations under this EULA to another person if Roku agrees in writing. This EULA is between you and 
	 	
136 
	 	
   
Roku. No other person shall have any rights to enforce these terms. Each of the paragraphs of this EULA operates 
separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will 
remain in full force and effect. If Roku fails to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this EULA, or if 
Roku does not enforce its rights against you, or if Roku delays in doing so, that will not mean that Roku has waived its 
rights against you, or that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If Roku does waive a default by you, 
Roku will only do so in writing, but that will not mean that Roku will automatically waive any later default by you. 
Contact Information 
If you wish to contact Roku, please send your correspondence by mail to Roku, Inc., 150 Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, 
CA  95032 USA, or by email to customerservice@roku.com.

décompiler, désassembler, désosser ou autrement extraire le code source du Logiciel, sauf dans la mesure où ces 
gestes ne peuvent être interdits en vertu de la loi applicable parce qu’ils sont essentiels à l’interopérabilité du Logiciel 
avec un autre logiciel, et pourvu que les renseignements obtenus par vous au cours de ces activités sont (i) utilisés 
uniquement pour réaliser cette interopérabilité; (ii) non divulgués sans le consentement écrit de Roku obtenu 
préalablement; et (iii) ne sont pas utilisés pour créer un logiciel qui est substantiellement similaire au Logiciel; (e) 
usurper, contourner ou gêner tout mécanisme de sécurité ou toute mesure de contrôle d’accès, ou (f) faire effectuer 
ce qui précède pour vous par un tiers. Cette licence n’inclut pas le droit de recevoir des mises à jour ou des mises à

VOTRE GARANTIE RELATIVE AU TÉLÉVISEUR EST FOURNIE PAR LE FABRICANT DU TÉLÉVISEUR ET NON PAS 
PAR ROKU. ROKU NE VOUS OFFRE AUCUNE GARANTIE EN VERTU DU PRÉSENT CLUF. SANS RESTREINDRE LA

SATISFAISANTE, D’ADÉQUATION À UN USAGE PARTICULIER ET D’ABSENCE DE CONTREFAÇON. ROKU 
NE PEUT GARANTIR, DÉCLARER NI CERTIFIER QUE LE TÉLÉVISEUR, LE CODE SOUS LICENCE DISTINCTE 
ET LE LOGICIEL SERONT : (I) SÉCURISÉS, SANS VIRUS OU SANS ERREUR, OU (II) DÉNUÉS DE TOUTE 
ATTAQUE OU INTRUSION DE SÉCURITÉ.  
(B)  EN AUCUN CAS ROKU, SES ADMINISTRATEURS, SES DIRIGEANTS OU SES EMPLOYÉS NE SERONT

Contrôles à l’exportation  
Vous acceptez de ne pas télécharger tout Contenu ou Logiciel, ni autrement exporter ou réexporter tout Téléviseur ou 
Logiciel dans (ou à un ressortissant ou un résident de) Cuba, Irak, Libye, Corée du Nord, Iran, Syrie ou tout autre pays 
contre lequel les États-Unis ou votre pays tient un embargo, ou à toute personne figurant sur la List of Specially 
Designated Nationals du Treasury Department des États-Unis ou du Table of Denial Orders du Commerce Department 
des États-Unis ou toute autre liste restreinte similaire publiée par votre gouvernement de temps à autre. En utilisant un 
Téléviseur ou le Logiciel, vous représentez un pays autre que ceux figurant sur une telle liste et vous garantissez que 
vous n’êtes pas situé dans un tel pays, sous le contrôle d’un tel pays, ou que vous n’êtes pas un ressortissant ou un 
résident d’un tel pays.  
Choix de compétence; règlement des litiges  
A.  Si vous êtes un consommateur ou un résident d’un pays appartenant au territoire économique européen 
dans lequel la vente du Téléviseur est expressément autorisée par son fabricant, le présent CLUF ne 
s’applique pas à votre cas.  
B.  Dans tous les autres cas, notamment si vous êtes un résident des États-Unis (et de ses possessions et 
territoires) ou du Canada, vous acceptez que cet accord de licence soit régi par les lois de l’état de la 
Californie, sans tenir compte de tout conflit de principes de droit qui peut s’appliquer à la loi d’un autre 
territoire; et :  
1.  Vous et Roku acceptez d’être liés par les modalités énoncées ci-dessous pour résoudre toute 
réclamation entre vous et Roku résultant de tout aspect du présent CLUF ou relative à celle-ci, qu’elle se 
fonde sur un contrat, un délit civil, une loi, une fraude, une fausse déclaration ou toute autre théorie 
juridique, y compris, mais sans s’y limiter, à des réclamations entre vous et Roku liées au Téléviseur et au 
Logiciel. Chaque réclamation est dénommée individuellement en tant que « Réclamation » et 
collectivement en tant que « Réclamations ».  
2.  VOUS ET ROKU CONSENTEZ À CE QUE TOUTE RÉCLAMATION ENTRE VOUS ET ROKU SOIT 
TRANCHÉE DE FAÇON DÉFINITIVE PAR ARBITRAGE, À L’EXCEPTION DES RÉCLAMATIONS QUI 
FIGURENT AU PARAGRAPHE 4 CI-APRÈS DE LA PRÉSENTE SECTION. L’arbitrage doit avoir lieu dans 
le comté de Santa Clara, en Californie, et doit être administré par l’American Arbitration Association (l’« 
AAA ») suivant les règles en vigueur de l’AAA, incluant (le cas échéant) les Procédures Additionnelles de 
l’AAA concernant les différends de consommateurs. Soyez informé qu’il n’y a aucun juge ni jury en 
arbitrage. Les procédures d’arbitrage sont simplifiées et plus limitées que les règles applicables devant 
les tribunaux et la révision des décisions de l’arbitre par un tribunal est limitée. VOUS ET ROKU 
CONSENTEZ EN OUTRE À CE QUE VOUS ET ROKU PUISSIEZ PRÉSENTER UNE RÉCLAMATION À 
L’ENCONTRE DE L’AUTRE PARTIE UNIQUEMENT SUR UNE BASE INDIVIDUELLE ET NON À TITRE DE 
REQUÉRANT OU DE MEMBRE D’UN GROUPE DANS TOUTE ACTION OU TOUT RECOURS COLLECTIF. 
L’ARBITRE NE PEUT CONSOLIDER OU JOINDRE PLUS D’UNE RÉCLAMATION PAR PERSONNE ET NE 
PEUT PRÉSIDER AUCUN RECOURS CONSOLIDÉ OU COLLECTIF. L’ARBITRE PEUT ACCORDER TOUTE 
FORME DE RÉPARATION (INCLUANT UNE RÉPARATION MONÉTAIRE, INJONCTION OU MESURE 
DÉCLARATOIRE) SUR UNE BASE INDIVIDUELLE SEULEMENT ET NE PEUT ACCORDER AUCUNE 
FORME DE RÉPARATION CONSOLIDÉE OU COLLECTIVE. Nonobstant toute disposition contraire, si la 
renonciation au recours collectif prévue au présent paragraphe est jugée invalide ou non exécutoire ou si 
un arbitrage est autorisé à procéder sur une base collective, ni vous ni Roku ne serez dès lors autorisés à 
	 	
140 
	 	
   
soumettre les Réclamations à l’arbitrage. La présente clause d’arbitrage est assujettie au Federal 
Arbitration Act. La décision de l’arbitre liera vous et Roku et peut être homologuée par tout tribunal 
compétent.  
3.  Vous trouverez les renseignements concernant l’AAA et la façon dont l’arbitrage est initié à l’adresse 
www.adr.org ou en téléphonant au 800-778-7879. Pour toute Réclamation entre Vous et Roku de 75 
000 USD et moins, vous serez responsable des frais initiaux de demande d’arbitrage, jusqu’à 
concurrence du montant des frais initiaux de la demande que vous auriez été appelé à payer pour une 
poursuite judiciaire initiée pour ces mêmes Réclamations à l’encontre de Roku devant les tribunaux. Si 
l’arbitre juge les Réclamations non frivoles, Roku paiera la différence entre de tels frais plus les frais de 
l’arbitrage. Pour toute Réclamation entre vous et Roku qui excède 75 000 USD, si vous êtes en mesure 
de démontrer que les frais de l’arbitrage sont prohibitifs par rapport aux frais de justice, Roku paiera le 
montant de vos frais de demande réels et les frais de l’arbitrage, jugés nécessaires par l’arbitre afin 
d’éviter que les frais d’arbitrage ne deviennent prohibitifs par rapport aux frais de justice.  
4.  Cette convention d’arbitrage ne concerne pas toute revendication (a) dans laquelle une partie tente de 
protéger ses droits de propriété intellectuelle (tels que son brevet, copyright, marque déposée, secret 
commercial, ou des droits moraux, mais ne comprenant pas sa vie privée ou les droits de publicité ), ou 
(b) qui peut être intentée devant le tribunal des petites créances. 
5.  Si cette entente d’arbitrage est jugée invalide, non exécutoire ou inapplicable pour une Réclamation 
donnée entre Vous et Roku, toute procédure visant à résoudre telle Réclamation devra dès lors être 
présentée exclusivement devant un tribunal fédéral ayant juridiction dans le District Nord de Californie 
ou un tribunal d’État du comté de Santa Clara en Californie. Vous consentez irrévocablement à la 
juridiction exclusive de ces tribunaux.  
6.  Droit de retrait de 30 jours :  vous avez le droit de vous retirer de cette entente d’arbitrage en envoyant un 
avis écrit de votre décision de vous retirer à l’adresse suivante :  Legal Department, Roku, Inc., 150 
Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, CA  95032, États-Unis; à condition que le cachet d’un tel avis soit daté du 
30e jour, ou moins, suivant le premier événement se produisant parmi les choix ci-après, si vous ne 
possédez pas encore de Compte Roku Account : (a) la date d’achat de Votre Téléviseur ou (b) la date 
de création de votre Compte Roku. Si vous possédez un compte Roku, tous les appareils que vous 
choisissez de lier à votre compte Roku et tous les services fournis par Roku qui sont accessibles à l’aide 
de ces appareils seront soumis à cette convention d’arbitrage. Votre avis doit indiquer votre prénom et 
nom complets, votre adresse postale, votre numéro de téléphone et votre adresse courriel actuels, le 
nom du produit et le numéro de série afférent à votre Téléviseur, ainsi qu’une copie de la preuve 
originale de l’achat de votre Téléviseur. Si vous envoyez en temps opportun un avis en conformité avec 
le présent paragraphe 6, la convention d’arbitrage ne pourra pas s’appliquer à vous-même ou à Roku. Si 
vous ne transmettez pas cet avis dans les délais impartis, alors vous consentez à être lié par cette 
entente d’arbitrage.  
7.  Nonobstant toute disposition contraire de cette Entente, vous reconnaissez que si Roku veut supprimer 
ou modifier substantiellement l’entente d’arbitrage ci-devant, ladite suppression ou modification ne 
s’appliquera pas à une Réclamation individuelle pour laquelle vous avez avisé Roku préalablement à 
ladite suppression ou modification.  
Divers  
En vertu de ce CLUF, Roku peut transférer ses droits et ses obligations à une autre organisation. Vous pouvez 
uniquement transférer vos droits ou vos obligations en vertu de ce CLUF à une autre personne si Roku y consent par 
écrit. Ce CLUF est entre vous et Roku. Aucune autre personne n’aura le droit de faire respecter ces conditions. Chacun 
des paragraphes du présent CLUF a effet séparément. Si un tribunal ou une autre autorité compétente décide que l’un 
d’entre eux est illicite, les paragraphes restants resteront en vigueur. Si Roku ne parvient pas à s’assurer que vous 
respectez vos obligations aux termes du présent CLUF ou si Roku n’applique pas ses droits contre vous, ou si Roku 
tarde à le faire, cela ne signifiera pas que Roku a renoncé à ses droits contre vous, ou que vous n’avez pas à vous 
conformer à ces obligations. Si Roku renonce à intenter un recours en cas de manquement de votre part, Roku ne le 
fera que par écrit, mais cela ne signifiera pas que Roku renoncera automatiquement à tout manquement ultérieur de 
vous.
