have been swallowed or placed inside any part of the body, seek immediate medical attention. To avoid risk of 
explosion, fire or chemical burn, use caution in replacing the battery and replace only with an agency approved 
(e.g., UL) CR2032 or DL2032 3-volt lithium battery. Properly and promptly dispose of used batteries. Do not
