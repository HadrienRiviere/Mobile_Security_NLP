2. Understand the cables
Find the call-for-heat circuit in the 
heating system 
The circuit may run directly from 
the thermostat to the boiler or pass 
through a junction box 
If there’s a combi boiler with no 
junction box, the Heat Link will be 
connected directly to the boiler’s 
control circuit  
You may need to test each cable 
to understand its function 
Make sure you connect the 
correct cables to the Heat Link 
to avoid blowing a fuse
