12 HomeHealth 
Canary’s HomeHealth Technology™ 
analyzes the temperature, humidity, and  
Technology™ air quality in your environment to help  
keep you safer and more connected to  
your home.
Your home’s current environmental 
conditions are displayed on the Home 
Screen, under the temperature, humidity, 
and air quality icons. Tap on any of  
these icons to view a 24 hour history of  
your HomeHealth data.   
Temperature
Canary tracks your home’s climate and 
shows you real-time temperature  
readings along with recent heat spikes  
or drops. These measurements can help 
you monitor your comfort, your utilities  
bill, and your safety.
Humidity
Humidity measures how much water  
vapor is in the air in your home. 
Humidity, along with temperature, can affect 
your overall health as well as structural 
factors in your house or apartment.
13 Air Quality
Canary assesses your home’s indoor air 
quality—the amount of contaminants in the 
air—and shows you what’s inside and outside 
the normal range for your environment.
Canary detects changes in air quality  
caused by pollutants including:
•  Isobutane
•  Hydrogen
•  Methane
•  Ethanol
•  Carbon monoxide
•  Cigarette smoke 
•  Cooking odors
You can keep Canary’s air quality sensor 
calibrated by ventilating your home with  
outside air. Make a habit of opening windows  
or doors to let fresh air in and help Canary  
stay as accurate as possible.
 
Air quality can also be affected by  
temperature, humidity, and seasonal  
climate changes in your environment.
While Canary’s air quality sensor can detect 
carbon monoxide and smoke, Canary isn’t 
a replacement  for a dedicated carbon 
monoxide or smoke detector in your home.

Technology™, please visit our Help Center.
