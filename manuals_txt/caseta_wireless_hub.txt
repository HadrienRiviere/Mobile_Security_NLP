a 4-way switch (four screws which control the lights, plus one ground

a 4-way switch (four screws which control the lights, plus one ground

Identify existing wiring Choose a location for your Caséta Wireless fan control
Location 1 Location 2 To Fan Location 3 NOTE: There will be two different types of existing switches in this 
application. Locations 1 and 3 will use 3-way switches (three screws  
which control the fan, plus one ground screw) and Location 2 will use a 
4-way switch (four screws which control the fan, plus one ground screw). 
For easiest installation, we recommend replacing one of the 3-way 
switches with your fan control (Locations 1 or 3). In this example, we will 
use Location 1.
Three or more switches control the fan  
(multi-location installation)
Important note:
-  If one switch controls the fan (single-pole installation)  3-Way Switch  4-Way Switch 
See quick-start guide that came with your fan control Locations 1 and 3 Location 2
-  If two switches control the fan (3-way installation)

To test sensor coverage, a 3MT CommandT adhesive strip is 
provided for temporarily mounting the sensor. The strip is not 
reusable and should not be used for permanently mounting the 
sensor.
Before mounting the sensor, please note the following:
– If you cannot see the sensor, it cannot see you. 
–  The sensor should be mounted at eye level. Recommended 
placement height 6 ft to 8 ft (1.8 m to 2.4 m).

is paired to a Caséta Wireless in-wall dimmer allowing the user to adjust the brightness of the bedroom light. The Auto-On setting is set 
to "Disabled", requiring the light to be turned on manually, but allowing for the sensor to automatically turn the light Off. This setting is 
recommended for bedrooms so the sensor won’t turn on the lights when it sees movement while a person is sleeping.

Staircase
A Caséta Wireless motion sensor is mounted flat on the ceiling, perpendicular to the staircase. If there is a railing present (or one side of 
staircase is open to an adjacent area as shown below), align the top of the sensor with the railing (or edge of adjacent area), and the bottom 
of the sensor facing the wall, so the sensor only "sees" the staircase and not the adjacent area. The sensor and Pico wireless control with 
wallplate are paired to a Caséta Wireless in-wall switch that controls the light in the staircase. The Auto-On setting is set to "Enabled", 
allowing for the sensor to automatically turn the light On / Off when a person enters / exits the staircase.

Motion Sensor Advanced Features
  
4
Off While Occupied
When the load control is manually turned OFF, the sensor will not 
turn the lights back ON automatically while the room is occupied. 
Once the room is vacated, the Auto-On feature returns to normal 
operation after the timeout period has expired. (Feature only 
available when Auto-On is enabled). 
The motion sensor has several advanced set-up features. For the 
majority of installations, the default settings will provide the best 
performance and you will not need to utilize the advanced set-up.
The motion sensor has three adjustable advanced set-up modes: 
Timeout, Activity, and Auto-On.

Auto-On (PD-OSENS model only) 
The automatic-on functionality of the sensor can be adjusted to 
control how the lights respond upon initial occupancy. There are two 
available settings: Enabled and Disabled. (Default: Enabled)
Enabled:   The lights will always turn on automatically on 
occupancy and automatically turn off after vacancy. 
Also known as occupancy mode.
Disabled:   The lights will not turn on automatically on 
occupancy, but will still turn off automatically after 
vacancy. After the lights turn off, a 15 second grace 
period allows for lights to turn back on if motion is 
detected. This is also known as vacancy mode.
Recommendations: For applications in bedrooms or when pets 
are in the space, it’s suggested to change Auto-on setting to 
Disabled.

switch to desired position.
Fan vibrates or wobbles. •  Fan direction switch is between forward and reverse. Set in-wall 
switch to desired position.
•  Fan blades must be balanced. See fan manufacturers installation 
guide to balance fan.
Fan speed is too slow. Set fan pull chain speed to high.
Fan does not respond to Pico remote control. •  The fan control failed to pair with Pico remote control. 
•  The fan control is already at the fan speed level that the Pico 
remote control is sending.
