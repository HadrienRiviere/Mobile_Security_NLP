About Users 
The Administrator, normally the device owner, is the person in charge of setting up the 
device. As the My Cloud EX2 Ultra device owner, you have a special user account 
(admin) that provides you with administrator privileges. With these privileges, you can set 
up and configure the device to your specific needs and add other users to your private 
cloud. You also have the power to determine exactly what users can access on the 
device.
As a default, the administrator (admin) user name does not have a password. You can 
create one at anytime (see “ Updating a User Password” on page 24).
Note: Only one individual at a time can use the Administrator logon ID to log into the 
web browser app. Because of this, ensure that you log out of the  
My Cloud EX2 Ultra device web browser app when you’re not using it. This allows 
other users authorized to use the Administrator logon ID to access the web 
browser app.  
 
See Energy Saver - Web Access Timeout on “Energy Saver” on page 83 to

User quota must be ≤ the group quota (e.g., if your group has a 20GB quota and 

you try to set the user quota to 30GB quota, you will be prompted to reduce your 
user quota to be equal to or less then the group quota).
If the user quota is not set, the group quota is assigned to the user.

When a user quota is set prior to joining a group and a group is assigned:

- If the user quota > group quota, the individual user ‘s quota is automatically 
reduced to the group quota amount.
- If the user quota is ≤ group quota, the individual user quota remains unchanged.

MY CLOUD EX2 ULTRA PRIVATE CLOUD STORAGE 56 
USER MANUAL MANAGING STORAGE ON MY CLOUD EX2 ULTRA
RAID Storage
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) allows you to store the same data in 
different places on multiple hard drives, providing necessary redundancy, greater 
performance, and data integrity. There are several different levels of RAID, each one 
providing a different method of sharing or distributing data among the drives. Your My 
Cloud EX2 Ultra device allows you to select from the following storage modes:
RAID Mode  Description
JBOD The use of one or more drives not in a RAID configuration but managed as 
separate logical volumes.
Spanning Combination of drives in a linear fashion to create one large logical volume.
RAID 0 RAID 0 mode provides disk striping across all drives in the RAID drive group.  
RAID 0 does not provide data redundancy but does provide the best 
performance of any RAID levels. RAID 0 breaks up data into smaller segments 
and stripes the data segments across each drive in the drive group.
RAID 1 In RAID 1 mode, the RAID controller duplicates all data from one drive to a 
second drive in the drive group. RAID 1 provides complete data redundancy but 
cuts the required storage capacity in half.
Viewing the Current RAID Mode
Use the following steps to view the RAID mode currently being used on your device.
1  .   On the navigation bar, click Storage to display the Storage screen.
2  .    Click RAID, if not already selected.

Spanning Combination of drives in a linear fashion to create one large logical 
volume.
RAID 0 Data is striped across multiple hard drives, enabling accelerated 
reading and recording of data by combining the work of two or 
more drives to increase performance.
RAID 1 Two instantaneous copies of the data are recorded on separate 
hard drives so if one of them fails, other(s) continue to read/write 
data until the faulty hard drive is replaced.

iSCSI Storage
Internet SCSI (iSCSI) is an industry standard developed to enable transmission of iSCSI 
block storage commands and data over an existing IP network by using the TCP/IP 
protocol. The encapsulated iSCSI commands and data can be transmitted over a local 
area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN). As with traditional SCSI, an iSCSI 
storage solution requires at least one “initiator” residing on the client computer and at 
least one “target” residing on the storage server.
Once the connection is established between the iSCSI initiator and the iSCSI target, the 
operating system on the iSCSI initiator sees the storage as a local storage device that 
can be formatted, read, and written in the usual manner.
My Cloud EX2 Ultra allows you to create and manage iSCSI targets. The iSCSI target 
provides storage, similar to a local hard disk drive, but is accessed over a network rather 
then locally. The iSCSI target is protected by the underlying RAID structure of the My 
Cloud EX2 Ultra server.
iSCSI Roles
Initiator: A client computer that accesses storage devices using iSCSI commands 

over an IP network.
Target: A network-attached storage device that provides access to logical disks 

(which can be created on the My Cloud EX2 Ultra server).
Creating an iSCSI Target
Use the following steps to create an iSCSI target
1  .   On the navigation bar, click Storage to display the Storage screen.

Media Servers
My Cloud EX2 Ultra is designed to serve as your home's media server. It enables you to 
stream photos, music, and videos to your DLNA-compatible devices and music to your 
iTunes-compatible devices.
Both DLNA-compatible and iTunes-compatible devices search for media stored in any 
Public share that has media serving enabled. By default, DLNA Media is disabled. Once 
you enable it on the Settings > Media Server page, the media serving for the Public share 
is also automatically enabled. For all other shares, the media serving remains off.
If you do not want DLNA to display specific media files, place them in a private share that 
is set to disable media sharing. (See “Making a Share Private” on page 30.)
Media Server Overview
The My Cloud EX2 Ultra device uses TwonkyMedia as its DLNA media server. It streams 
your music, photos and videos to compatible devices in your home. Playing media on a 
compatible device is easy.
The media server searches for all the media stored in the Public share on the My Cloud 
EX2 Ultra device connected to your home network. After enabling media serving for the 
device (see “Enabling DLNA and iTunes” on page 72), you can just transfer your multimedia 
content to the Public share on your My Cloud EX2 Ultra device, and you are ready to 
stream and view content on your home entertainment center, game consoles (for 
example, Xbox 360® or PlayStation® 3), WD TV Live® media player, or DLNA® 1.5 digital 
media adapters), and other PC computers on your home or office network. Visit  
http://www.dlna.org for further information on DLNA.
iTunes Overview
You or anyone connected to the My Cloud EX2 Ultra device can use iTunes to play stored 
music files. iTunes creates a virtual music library on the device and treats it as an iTunes 
repository, making it possible to stream music files from the My Cloud EX2 Ultra device to 
Windows or Mac computers running iTunes.
iTunes scans any shares that have the Media Serving setting enabled, including the 
Public share by default.

Media Storage
You can access and store media content on the My Cloud EX2 Ultra device by means of 
network shares. Shares, similar to folders or directories, are areas set up to organize 
media and access them from your network. Shares can be shared with everyone (public) 
or with selected users on your network (private).
The device comes pre-configured with the Public network share, which contains the 
following folders for media storage: 
•   Shared Music—Stores music files you want to share with other users.
•   Shared Pictures—Stores image files you want to share with other users. 
•   Shared Videos—Stores video files you want to share with other users. 
Note: You will notice that the Public share's Shared Music and Shared Pictures shares 
contain mirrored and uploaded subfolders. These folders are needed by Twonky 
7.2. You can now upload all media types to the uploaded subfolder from a DLNA 
client with "upload" capability.  
 
Go to the Twonky configuration site (NAS_IP:9000) to aggregate content from all 
NAS devices with DLNA capability on your network to the mirrored folder. 
Uploading and mirroring are best left to expert users, as these features are not 
supported by  
WD customer support.

MY CLOUD EX2 ULTRA PRIVATE CLOUD STORAGE 104 
USER MANUAL REGULATORY AND WARRANTY INFORMATION
warranty depends on the country in which your Product was purchased. If the Product you purchased is a 2-
Bay or 4-Bay Product that is pre-populated with WD hard disk drives preinstalled, the term of your limited 
warranty for such Product shall be 3 years in the North, South, and Central America region, 3 years in the

limited warranty for such Product shall be 2 years in the North, South, and Central America region, 2 years in 
the Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region, and 2 years in the Asia Pacific region, unless otherwise 
required by law. The term of your limited warranty period shall commence on the purchase date appearing on 
your purchase receipt. WD may at its discretion make extended warranties available for purchase. WD shall 
have no liability for any Product returned if WD determines that the Product was stolen from WD or that the 
asserted defect a) is not present, b) cannot reasonably be rectified because of damage occurring before WD 
receives the Product, or c) is attributable to misuse, improper installation, alteration (including removing or 
obliterating labels and opening or removing external enclosures, including the mounting frame, unless the 
product is on the list of limited user-serviceable products and the specific alteration is within the scope of the 
applicable instructions, as found at http://support.wd.com), accident or mishandling while in the possession of 
someone other than WD. Subject to the limitations specified above, your sole and exclusive warranty shall be, 
during the period of warranty specified above and at WD’s option, the repair or replacement of the Product 
with an equivalent or better Product. The foregoing warranty of WD shall extend to repaired or replaced 
Products for the balance of the applicable period of the original warranty or ninety (90) days from the date of 
shipment of a repaired or replaced Product, whichever is longer.
The foregoing limited warranty is WD’s sole warranty and is applicable only to products sold as new. The 
remedies provided herein are in lieu of a) any and all other remedies and warranties, whether expressed, 
implied or statutory, including but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a

accidental, consequential, or special damages, or any financial loss, lost profits or expenses, or lost data 
arising out of or in connection with the purchase, use, or performance of the Product, even if WD has been 
advised of the possibility of such damages. In the United States, some states do not allow exclusion or 
limitations of incidental or consequential damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. This 
warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.
