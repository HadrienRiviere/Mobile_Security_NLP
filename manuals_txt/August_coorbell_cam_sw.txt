Check  Doorbell  Chime  Type 
If your  existing  doorbell  has  a  speaker,  it's  a  digital  chime.  If  it  has  a  mechanical  mechanism 
(usually  in  the  form  of two  pistons  that  strike  metallic  keys),  it's  a  compatible  mechanical  chime. 
You'll  need  to  ensure  that  your  doorbell  is  getting  16-24V  from  the  transformer.

Optimize  Your  Wireless  Connection 
For  best  performance,  your Wi-Fi  access  point  should  be  within  15-20ft  of your  door.  Try  to 
ensure  that  your Wi-Fi  access  point  is  on  the  same  floor  and  as  close  to  your  Doorbell  Cam  as 
possible.  If  it  is  too  far,  the  Doorbell  Cam  will  not  get  a  proper  signal.  Multiple  stories  or 
brick/stone  walls  within  your  home  may  also  contribute  to  signal  interference.

Be  Aware  of  Your  Installation  Surface 
Surfaces  such  as  brick,  concrete,  cement  siding  and  stucco  will  require  a  masonry  bit  for 
drilling. 
Also  note  that  certain  surface  types  such  as  brick  and  stucco  can  cause  Wi-Fi  interference. 
Stucco,  for  example,  usually  contains  metal  mesh  wiring  which  can  dramatically  reduce  the 
strength  of your Wi-Fi  signal. 
Start  With  the  Included  USB  Setup  Dock 
The  first  step  will  be  to  set  up  your  Doorbell  Cam  Pro  using  the  included  Setup  Dock.  Plug  one 
end  of the  included  USB  cable  into  the  Setup  Dock,  and  the  other  end  into  a  power  source 
such  as  a  computer  or  smartphone  charger.  Place  your  Doorbell  Cam  Pro  onto  the  dock  and 
press  the  Reset  button  on  the  back.  to  power  it  on.  Begin  setup  of your  Doorbell  Cam  Pro  using 
the  August  mobile  app.
