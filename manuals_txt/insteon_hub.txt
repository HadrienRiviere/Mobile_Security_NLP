30 Troubleshooting
Initial Setup and Configuration
Unable to create an Insteon account
There is most likely an internet connection issue between your mobile device and the Insteon Hub
Try this:
•  Make sure your internet connection is working by trying to browse a website on your mobile device
•  Look for any typos in your email address that might prevent the account from creating; if you are missing 
the “@” symbol or “.com,” add them. Insteon requires a full, valid email address.
Insteon App is unable to find your Insteon Hub
A number of factors can impact the initial setup but most of them are internet connection related.
Try this:
•  Check all of the cables going into the Hub and make sure they are firmly seated. Trace the ethernet cable 
from the Hub back to the router and make sure it is connected properly there, too.
•  Look for signs of life from the Insteon Hub. Even if not properly connected, you should see a green LED 
glow on the front of the Hub. If the LED doesn’t illuminate, check the power outlet. There should also be a 
blinking green and solid orange light on the Hub’s ethernet port. If both ethernet LEDs are off, try a different 
port on your router.
•  Try power cycling your Hub by unplugging and then reconnecting it to power.
•  For the initial connection, your mobile device must be connected to the WiFi network being generated by 
the same router to which the Hub is connected. While some routers create a “guest” network, you most 
often need to be connected to the main WiFi network being created by your router for the initial setup to 
work correctly.
•  You can check to see if the Insteon Hub was able to properly “phone home” to Insteon. This will at least 
tell you that the Hub is up and running, even if a network configuration problem is preventing you from 
connecting to the Hub. On your mobile device or computer, open a browser and visit connect.insteon.com/
getinfo.asp. Any detected Insteon Hubs will be displayed on this page.
•  Try a network reset (see Network Reset).
•  If the problem persists, contact Insteon Support 866-243-8022
Insteon App is unable to connect to your Insteon Hub
A number of factors can impede connection to the Insteon Hub but most of them are internet connection 
related.
Try this:
•  Check all of the cables going into the Hub and make sure they are firmly seated. Trace the ethernet cable 
from the Hub back to the router and make sure it is connected properly there, too.
•  Look for signs of life from the Insteon Hub. Even if not properly connected, you should see a green LED 
glow on the front of the Hub. If the LED doesn’t illuminate, check the power outlet. There should also be a 
blinking green and solid orange light on the Hub’s ethernet port. If both ethernet LEDs are off, try a different 
port on your router.
•  Ensure that your home internet connection is functioning by visiting a website from your computer’s internet 
browser.
•  Restart your Hub by unplugging and then reconnecting it to power.
31 Troubleshooting
General Issues
Unable to add a new device using the Insteon App
Inability to add a new device is usually centered around issues with the Insteon network.
Try this:
•  Relocate the new device closer to the Insteon Hub and try again. If this works, you may need a Range 
Extender or an additional Dual-Band Insteon device to increase the reach of your Insteon Network.
•  Log out of the Insteon App and sign back in. From the Insteon App, navigate to Settings and tap Log Out at 
the bottom of the screen.
Unable to delete a device using the Insteon App
Deleting a device from the Insteon App may encounter issues if that device is no longer present or connected in 
your home.
Try this:
•  Ensure that the device to be deleted is plugged in or otherwise powered. If it is a battery powered device, 
press and hold the set button until the Status LED begins blinking and then try deleting from the App.
•  If the device to be deleted has stopped functioning, you can force the Insteon App to delete the device but 
only after attempts to delete the device are unsuccessful by the app. You will be presented with an option 
to Force Remove the unresponsive device.
•  Log out of the Insteon App and sign back in. From the Insteon App, navigate to Settings and tap Log Out at 
the bottom of the screen.
Unable to add a new WiFi Camera using the Insteon App
There are several points to check when a WiFi Camera cannot be added using the Insteon App.
Try this:
•  Ensure that your router is functioning properly and that the Ethernet cable connecting the WiFi Camera is 
firmly connected to both the camera and your router.
•  Confirm that the WiFi camera has power.
•  Log out of the Insteon App and sign back in. From the Insteon App, navigate to Settings and tap Log Out at 
the bottom of the screen.
Unable to receive alerts via email or SMS
With iOS version 1.9.25 and Android version 1.7.4, SMS alerts are no longer supported in favor of push 
notifications. The Insteon Connect cloud service may require updating if an alert setting was not properly saved.
Try this:
•  Check your email for an email from Insteon Connect. After initially configuring alerts, a confirmation link 
needs to be clicked to confirm that you wish to enable alerts for the specified email address. This email may 
32 Troubleshooting
General Issues
have been inadvertently routed to your spam folder or deleted.
•  Disable and then re-enable alerts for the device that is not transmitting alerts.
•  Ensure that a recipient email address is entered for the alert.
•  Ensure that the Insteon for Hub app has permission to send push notifications. From the home screen of 
your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, navigate to Settings. Scroll to the bottom of the list and locate Insteon. 
In the “Allow Insteon to Access” section, tap Notifications. Flip the switch to green to enable push 
notifications. You will still need to configure push notifications on a per-device basis from within the Insteon 
app.
Unable to disable alerts via email
The Insteon Connect cloud service may require updating if an alert setting was not properly saved.
Try this:
•  Log out of the Insteon App and sign back in.
•  Delete the device for which alerts cannot be disabled and then re-add the device and enable alerts.
Schedules do not appear to run at the correct time
It is possible that the Hub’s clock is incorrect and requires resetting.
Try this:
•  From the Insteon App, navigate to Settings > House and check Hub Local Time. If this time is incorrect 
or if the Hub Location is incorrect, tap Hub Location and locate your Insteon Hub on the map. This will 
automatically update your Hub’s internal clock.
•  If updating the Hub time does not correct the schedule run time, try a Network Reset.
Check for firmware updates for your Insteon Hub
Your Hub will update its firmware automatically but you can manually check for updates.
Try this:
•  From the Insteon App, navigate to Settings > House and tap Check for Updates.
