to the camera. To do this, enable the NAT-traversal feature, which will attempt to 
automatically configure the router to allow access to the camera. This is enabled from 
Setup > System Options > Network > TCP/IP Advanced.
For more information, please see NAT traversal (port mapping) for IPv4, on page 34. See 
also the AXIS Internet Dynamic DNS Service at www.axiscam.net or, for Technical notes 
on this and other topics, visit the Axis Support Web at www.axis.com/techsup
3GPP Compatibility
The AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW is 3GPP compatible by default. To view live video over 
3GPP:
• Contact your cell phone provider and make sure that the configuration is correct. It is 
recommended that you have an account with a public IP address.
• Check that the camera has a completely public IP address, i.e. no ports blocked by a 
firewall.
• In Setup > Video & Image > Image Appearance, set the Resolution to 160x120 or 176x144
• In Setup > Video & Image > Advanced > MPEG-4 > Bit Rate Control, set the Maximum Bit 
Rate to 64 or 128 kbit/s

www.axis.com/techsup
Note:  Play/Stop buttons are also available when viewing the video stream in other browsers. AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - Video Streams  13 
Video Streams
The AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW provides several different image and video stream formats. 
The type you choose depends on your requirements and on the properties of your network. 
The Live View page in the camera provides access to MPEG-4 and Motion JPEG video 
streams, as well as to single JPEG images. Other applications and clients can also access 
these video streams/images directly, without going via the Live View page. 
How to stream MPEG-4
This video compression standard makes good use of bandwidth, and can provide 
high-quality video streams at less than 1 Mbit/s. Note that the image settings of the 
MPEG-4 stream are the same for all clients.
Deciding on the combination of protocols and methods to use depends on your viewing 
requirements, and on the properties of your network. The available options in AMC are:
Unicast RTP This unicast method (RTP over UDP) should be

HTTP walls. Firewalls are commonly configured to 
allow the HTTP protocol, thus allowing RTP to be 
tunneled.
Multicast RTP This method (RTP over UDP) should be used for live multicast video. The video stream is always 
up-to-date, even if some images are dropped.
Multicasting provides the most efficient usage of bandwidth when there are large numbers of clients 
viewing simultaneously. A multicast broadcast cannot however, pass a network router unless the 
router is configured to allow this. It is thus not possible to multicast over e.g. the Internet.
Note also that all multicast viewers count as one unicast viewer in the maximum total of 10 simulta-
neous connections.
When the Reconnect Strategy is not enabled, AMC will negotiate with the camera to 
determine exactly which transport protocol to use, in the order listed above. This order can 
be changed and the options disabled, to suit specific requirements. See also the AMC User’s 
manual, available from the Network Video link in www.axis.com/techsup
Important!
MPEG-4 is licensed technology. The AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW includes one viewing 
client license. Installing additional unlicensed copies of the viewing client is prohib-
ited. To purchase additional licenses, contact your Axis reseller.  14  AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - Video Streams

The AMC control panel is automatically installed on first use and can then be opened:
• From the Windows Control Panel (from the Start menu)
• By right-clicking the image in Internet Explorer and clicking Settings in the menu.
QuickTime™ & Real Player™
To access the video stream from QuickTime™ or Real Player™ for example, the following 
paths can be used:
• rtsp://<ip>/mpeg4/media.amp
• rtsp://<ip>/mpeg4/media.3gp
Notes: • The AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW supports QuickTime 6.5.1 (or later) and Real Player 10.5 (or later)
• QuickTime adds latency to the video and audio stream (up to 3 seconds)
• It may be possible to use other players to view the MPEG-4 stream using the paths above, although this is 
not guaranteed by Axis
• <ip> = IP address
Motion JPEG
This format uses standard JPEG still images for the video stream. These images are then 
displayed and updated at a rate sufficient to create a stream that shows constantly updated 
motion. 
The Motion JPEG stream uses considerable amounts of bandwidth, but provides excellent 
image quality and access to every image contained in the stream. The recommended 
method of accessing Motion JPEG live video from the AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW is to use 
the AXIS Media Control (AMC) in Microsoft Internet Explorer in Windows. 
Note also that multiple clients accessing Motion JPEG streams can use different image 
settings. AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - Video Streams  15 
Alternative methods of accessing the video stream
Video/images from the AXIS 207MW can also be accessed in the following ways:
• 3GPP - enter the following path:
• rtsp://<ip>/mpeg4/media.3gp  
Refer to 3GPP Compatibility, on page 9 for more information.
• Motion JPEG server push (if supported by the client, e.g. Firefox). This option maintains 
an open HTTP connection to the browser and sends data as and when required, for as 
long as required. See HTML Examples, on page 23.
• Still JPEG images in a browser. Enter e.g. the path: 
http://<ip>/axis-cgi/jpg/image.cgi?resolution=320x240
• Windows Media Player. This requires that you install AMC and the MPEG-4 viewing cli-
ent. The paths that can be used are listed below in the order of preference.
• Unicast via RTP:   axrtpu://<ip>/mpeg4/media.amp
• Unicast via RTSP: axrtsp://<ip>/mpeg4/media.amp
• Unicast via RTSP, tunneled via HTTP:  axrtsphttp://<ip>/mpeg4/media.amp 
• Multicast:  axrtpm://<ip>/mpeg4/media.amp

Configuration
This section describes how to configure the camera, and is intended for product 
Administrators, who have unrestricted access to all the configuration tools, within the 
Setup link; and Operators, who have access to the settings for Video & Image, Audio, Live 
View Config and Event Configuration. 
The camera is configured from the Setup link, from a standard browser.
Below are examples of the features available in the AXIS 207MW. For details of each 
setting, please refer to the online help available from the Setup link. Click  to access the 
online help.
Accessing the Setup link
Follow the instructions below to access the Setup link from a browser.
1. Start your browser and enter the IP address or host name of the camera in the 
location/address field.
2. The Live View page is now displayed. Click Setup to display menu options.
Setup link
AXIS Media Control
The AXIS Media Control (AMC) is automatically installed the first time the camera is 
accessed from Microsoft Internet Explorer. The AMC control panel can be opened by 
right-clicking on the video image on the Live View page. The control panel can be used to 
configure various video and audio settings. 
For more information, see the AMC User’s Manual, available on the CD supplied with this 
product, or from www.axis.com/techsup AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - Configuration   17 
Video and Image settings
Image Appearance
Use these settings to change the image as required. The image can be rotated, the image 
resolution and compression adjusted, and the white balance can be changed.
The configuration of the video image affects the camera’s overall performance, depending 
on how it is used, and on the available bandwidth. Setting higher resolution and lower 
compression improves video image quality, but increases the amount of bandwidth 
required. 
Please see the online help for further information on these settings.
Mirroring
Mirroring is the horizontal flipping of an image, that gives you another image perspective. 
This is a useful function when you need a direct view of the image, for example, in ATMs 
and door phones. The mirroring settings should be defined before you define the 
parameters for privacy masks and motion detection.  18  AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - Configuration
Overlay Settings
Use these settings to include text and 
date and time overlays. These overlays 
are included in one line, at the top or 
bottom of the video image.
Text, date and 
time overlay
Video Stream
Define the maximum video stream 
time per session in seconds, minutes or 
hours, or set it as unlimited. When the set time has expired, a new stream can be started by 
refreshing the page in the browser. Note that the maximum video stream time does not 
apply to clients connecting via multicast.
The frame rate allowed to each viewer can also be limited, to avoid bandwidth problems 
on the network. 
Test - For a preview of the image before saving, click Test. When satisfied with the 
settings, click Save. Please note that the preview image will be in JPEG format, even 
though the settings are valid both for Motion JPEG and MPEG-4. Please refer to the online 
help for more information. 
Advanced
Camera
Lighting Conditions - These settings help fine-tune the video image. They include the 
color level, brightness, sharpness and exposure control. Please see the online help   for 
further information on these settings. 
Low Light Behavior - Exposure priority defines the balance between image quality 
and the frame rate. Higher image quality may reduce frame rate and increase motion blur. 
A prioritized frame rate may instead increase the image noise. Depending on requirements, 
use this to give higher priority to the image quality or to the frame rate.
MPEG-4
GOV Settings - The GOV structure describes the composition of the MPEG-4 video 
stream. Setting the GOV-length to a high value saves considerably on bandwidth. The 
Cyclic refresh parameter gives a smoother bit rate and can be useful if bandwidth is 
limited.
Note: Cyclic refresh should not be enabled if Event handling is enabled and the file format is set to MPEG-4 in 
Upload images/video (see Setup > Event configuration > Event settings). AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - Configuration   19 
Bit Rate Control - Limiting the maximum bit rate is a good way of controlling the 
bandwidth used by the MPEG-4 video stream. Leaving the Maximum bit rate as Unlimited 
will provide consistently good image quality, but at the expense of increased bandwith 
usage whenever there is more activity in the image. Limiting the bit rate to a defined value 
will prevent excessive bandwidth usage, but images will be lost when the limit is exceeded.
Note that a maximum bit rate can be used for both variable and constant bit rates.
The bit rate type can be set as Variable Bit Rate (VBR) or Constant Bit Rate (CBR). VBR 
will adjust the bit rate according to the images' complexity, thus using a lot of bandwidth 
for a lot of activity in the image and less for lower activity in the monitored area.
MJPEG Settings
Sometimes the image size may get quite large due to low light or complex scenery. 
Adjusting the maximum frame size can control the bandwidth and storage used by the 
MJPEG video stream. An unlimited frame size value will result in increased bandwidth and 
storage usage during low light. Limiting the frame size will compromise the image quality. 
To prevent increase in bandwidth and storage usage, the maximum frame size should be 
set to an optimal amount. During ideal light conditions follow these instructions to 
optimize frame size: 
Click the View button and a pop-up window appears with Frame size and Compression in 
the text field. Note the current frame size. To calculate a maximum frame size add 10 - 
20% to the current frame size. Enter the calculated frame size in the Limited to… field. 
Verify the quality of the image in low light. Increase the maximum frame size if needed.
Note: The maximum frame size allowed increases compression in order to maintain a low 
frame size, starting at the compression value set under Image Settings > Image Appearance 
> Compression. When compression is 100, the image cannot be made smaller. You may 
also need to adjust the Resolution setting if a smaller frame size is needed. 
Audio
The built-in microphone in the AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW provides one-way MPEG-4, 
ISMA, 3GPP compatible audio.
Enable audio - Check the box option to enable Audio (disabled by default).
Audio input - These settings are used to fine-tune the audio stream. Please see the 
online help   for more information,
Note: To receive synchronized video and sound, it is recommended that the camera time is synchronized with an 
NTP Server. This is enabled under System Options > Date & Time. See the online help   for more infor-
mation.  20  AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - Live View Config

Event Config
Pre-defined parameters, known as an Event or Event Type can trigger certain actions in the 
camera. A common event type is an alarm that prompts the camera to upload images. 
Many event types use an Event Server, to receive uploaded images.
An event that is triggered by a signal, such as a door switch, motion detection, or system 
event, is called a triggered event.
A scheduled event runs at pre-programmed times.
An Action refers to what happens when the event occurs.
Triggered by...
Input port - This describes the 
state of the input when an event 
is triggered; for example, a door 
sensor connected to the camera’s 
input port. If the door sensor is 
active, an event is triggered.
Manual trigger - This option makes 
use of the action buttons on the 
live view page, which are used to 
start or stop the event manually. For example, they can activate an alarm connected to the 
camera’s output port. Alternatively the event can be triggered via the product's API 
(Application Programming Interface).
Motion detection - Movement in a motion detection window can be used to trigger an event. 
Select the motion detection window from the drop-down list and specify if the event is to 
be triggered at the stop or start of motion. For information on how to set up motion 
detection windows see Motion Detection, on page 26.
Audio trigger - This is used to trigger the event for changes in the sound level, as configured 
in Setup > Audio.
When Triggered...
Upload images/video - To upload images when the event type is triggered, check this box 
option to display a drop-down list with the available upload options. Selecting the upload 
type (FTP, HTTP or Email) displays further settings you can define. Please see the online

System Options
Security
The user access control in the AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW allows an administrator to set up 
and modify all users, by providing user names and passwords. It is also possible to allow 
anonymous viewer login, which means that anybody may access the Live View page, as 
described below:
Users - the user list displays the authorized users and user groups (levels):
User group Access privileges
Viewer Provides the lowest level of access, which only allows access to the Live View page.
Operator An Operator can view the Live View page, create and modify events and adjust certain other settings. 
Operators have no access to the System Options.
Administrator An administrator has unrestricted access to the Setup Tools and can determine the registration of all 
other users. 
The AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW supports different methods of user authentication:
HTTP Basic Authentication - This authenticates the user by requesting a user name and a 
password. The exchange of network credentials is in simple base64 coding and is not 
encrypted.
HTTP Digest Authentication - This method also requests a user name and password, but the 
exchange of credentials is encrypted, which secures it against eavesdropping.
User Settings - check the relevant box options to enable the following:
• Anonymous viewer login - allows any viewer direct access to the Live View 
page.
• Maximum number of simultaneous viewers - enter a value here to restrict the 
number of Motion JPEG and MPEG-4 viewers accessing the unit. This is useful if 
you need to save on bandwidth. Note that within the limit of 10 viewers, all mul-
ticast viewers count as 1 viewer.
IP Address Filter
Enable IP Address Filtering to allow or deny access to the camera. Once enabled, the IP 
addresses in the list are allowed or denied access according to the choice made in the 
drop-down list Allow/Deny the following IP addresses. 
The administrator can add up to 256 IP address entries to the list (a single entry can 
contain multiple IP addresses). The users from these IP addresses need to be specified in the 
user list with the appropriate access rights. This is done from Setup > System Options > 
Security > Users.  AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - System Options  29 
Referrals. 
To prevent unauthorized clients from including the video stream from the 
cameras into external Web pages, check the Referrals checkbox and enter the IP address or 
Host name of the computer that hosts the Web pages with the included video stream. 
Several IP addresses/host names can be defined and are separated by semicolons (;). This 
option is only applicable to Motion JPEG video streams.
Notes:  •If the referrals feature is enabled and you wish to also allow normal access to the Live View 
page, the product's own IP address or host name must be added to the list of allowed referrers.
•Restricting referrers has no effect on an MPEG-4 video stream. To restrict an MPEG-4 stream, IP 
address filtering must be enabled.
•Restricting referrers is of greatest value when not using IP address filtering. If IP address filter-
ing is used, then the allowed referrers are automatically restricted to those allowed IP 
addresses.
HTTPS
The AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW supports encrypted browsing using HTTPS. 
A self-signed certificate can be used until a Certificate Authority-issued certificate has 
been obtained. Click the Create self-signed Certificate button to install a self-signed 
certificate. Although self-signed certificates are free and offer some protection, true 
security will only be implemented after the installation of a signed certificate issued by a 
certificate authority. 
A signed certificate can be obtained from an issuing Certificate Authority by clicking the 
Create Certificate Request button. When the signed certificate is returned, click the Install 
signed certificate button to import the certificate. The properties of any certificate request

1024-65535. This is useful for e.g. simple security port mapping.
HTTPS 
The HTTPS port number. The default is 443.  34  AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - System Options
NAT traversal (port mapping) for IPv4
A broadband router allows devices on a private network (LAN) to share a single connection 
to the Internet. This is done by forwarding network traffic from the private network to the 
“outside” i.e. the Internet. Security on the private network (LAN) is increased since most 
broadband routers are pre-configured to stop any attempts to access the private network 
(LAN) from the public network/Internet.
Use NAT traversal when your camera is located on an intranet (LAN) and you wish to 
make it available from the other (WAN) side of a NAT router. With NAT traversal properly 
configured, all HTTP traffic to an external HTTP port in the NAT router will be forwarded 
to the camera.

router
Notes: • For NAT traversal to work, this must also be supported by the broadband router.
• The broadband router has many different names: “NAT router”, “Network router“, Internet Gateway”, 
“Broadband sharing device” or “Home firewall” but the essential purpose of the device is the same.
When enabled, the AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW will attempt to configure port mapping in a 
NAT router on your network, using UPnP™. Note that UPnP™ must be enabled in the 
camera (see System Options > Network > UPnP).
Use manually selected NAT router - Select this option to manually select a NAT router 
and enter the IP address for the router in the field provided.
If a router is not manually specified, the camera will automatically search for NAT routers 
on your network. If more than one router is found, the default router will be selected.
Alternative HTTP port - Select this option to manually define an external HTTP port. Enter 
the port number in the field provided. If no port is entered here a port number is 
automatically selected when NAT traversal is enabled. 
Notes: • An alternative HTTP port can be used/be active even if NAT traversal is disabled. This is useful if e.g. your 
NAT router does not support UPnP and you need to manually configure port forwarding in the NAT router.
• If you attempt to manually enter a port that is already in use, another available port will automatically be 
selected.
• When the port is automatically selected it will be displayed in this field. This can be changed by entering a 
new port number and clicking Save. AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - System Options  35 
FTP
The FTP server running in the AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW enables the upload of e.g. new 
firmware, user applications, etc. Check the box to enable the service. 
RTSP
The RTSP protocol allows a connecting client to start an MPEG-4 stream. Check the box to 
enable the RTSP server and enter the RTSP port number to use. The default setting is 554. 
Note that MPEG-4 streams will not be available if this is not enabled.
Network Traffic
Connection Type - The default setting is Auto-negotiate, which means that the correct 
speed is automatically selected. If necessary, you can set the connection speed by selecting 
it from the drop-down list.
Maximum bandwidth - To minimize the impact on other services running on your 
network, it is possible to configure the maximum network bandwidth the product will be 
allowed to use. Specify the maximum bandwidth (in Mbit/s or kbit/s) allowed, or set to 
Unlimited. 
For more information, please see the online help  .
Wireless
These settings should always be made first in the camera and in the wireless access point 
second. This ensures that the camera is always accessible when making changes. 
Using a wired connection and/or HTTPS ensures greater secrecy while making these 
settings.  36  AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - System Options
Status of Wireless Networks
This list is the result of a network scan. Access points with a disabled SSID Broadcast will 
not appear unless the camera is associated with it. The network currently associated to is 
shown in blue. A network using unsupported security is shown in grey. The following 
information is provided:
• SSID - The name of a wireless network (or ad-hoc device). If the same name occurs several 
times this means that several access points for that network were found. The camera 
cannot be configured to only associate with one particular access point.
• Mode - Shows if the network type is Master (access point or router) or Ad-Hoc (another 
client). 
• Security - Shows which type of security the network uses. See below for the security types 
supported by the camera.
• Channel - Shows the wireless channel currently in use.
• Signal strength - Shows the signal strength.
• Bit rate - Shows the bit rate in Mbit/s. This can only be shown for the access point 
currently in use. Note that the bit rate shown is the current rate, and that this value may 
vary over time.
Wireless Settings
These settings control how the camera interacts with the wireless network. Apart from 
identifying the wireless network, it is also possible to enable wireless encryption.
SSID - This is the name of the wireless network the camera is configured for. The field 
accepts up to 32 alphanumeric characters. The name must be exactly the same as that used 
in the wireless access point or the connection will not be established. 
Leaving this field blank means the camera will attempt to access the nearest open network. 
Note: SSID is sometimes written as ESSID. 
Network type - Setting this to Master means the camera will attempt to access the nearest 
open access point. The Ad-hoc option allows the camera to connect to other wireless 
devices (clients). 
Note that using Ad-hoc settings means that WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK encryption will not be 
available (see below).
Security - The AXIS 207MW supports two security methods:
• WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK (recommended method)
• WEP
Notes: • WPA-PSK is also known as WPA-Personal, and WPA2-PSK is also known as WPA2-Personal.
• WPA-Enterprise is not supported. AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - System Options  37 
WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access - Pre-Shared Key)
The AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW uses a pre-shared key (PSK) for key management. The 
pre-shared key can be entered either as Manual hex, as 64 hexadecimal (0-9, A-F) 
characters, or as a Passphrase, using 8 to 63 ASCII characters.
WEP (Wired Equivalent Protection)
WEP - Authentication - Select Open or Shared Key System Authentication, depending on the 
method used by your access point. Not all access points have this option, in which case 
they probably use Open System, which is sometimes known as SSID Authentication.
WEP - Key length - This sets the length of the key used for the wireless encryption, 64 or 128 
bit. The encryption key length can sometimes be shown as 40/64 and 104/128. 
WEP - Key Type - The key types available depend on the access point being used. The 
following options are available: 
• Manual - Allows you to manually enter the hex key. 
• ASCII - In this method the string must be exactly 5 characters for 64-bit WEP and 13 
characters for 128-bit WEP. 
• Passphrase - The passphrase can contain up to 31 characters. In 64-bit WEP, the 
Passphrase generates 4 different keys. For 128-bit WEP, only 1 key is generated, which is 
then replicated for all 4 keys. Key generation is not standardized and can differ from brand 
to brand. Check that the generated keys are identical to those in your access point - if not, 
they must be entered manually.
WEP - Active Transmit Key - When using WEP encryption, this selects which of the 4 keys 
the camera uses when transmitting.
SOCKS
SOCKS is a networking proxy protocol. The AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW can be configured 
to use a SOCKS server (version 4 or 5) to reach networks on the other side of a 
firewall/proxy server. This is useful if the camera is located on a local network behind a 
firewall, but notifications, uploads, alarms, etc., need to be sent to a destination outside the 
local network (e.g. to the Internet).
QoS (Quality of service)
Quality of Service (QoS) provides the means to guarantee a certain level of a specified 
resource to selected traffic on a network. Quality can be defined as e.g. a maintained level 
of bandwidth, low latency, no packet losses, etc. The main benefits of a QoS-aware 
network can be summarized as:
• The ability to prioritize traffic and thus allow critical flows to be served before 
flows with lesser priority.
• Greater reliability in the network, thanks to the control of the amount of band-
width an application may use, and thus control over bandwidth races between 
applications.  38  AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - System Options
The QoS in Axis network video products marks the data packets for various types of 
network traffic originating from the product. This makes it possible for network routers 
and switches to e.g. reserve a fixed amount of bandwidth for these types of traffic. The 
following types of traffic are marked:
• live video
• live audio
• event/alarm traffic
• management network traffic.
QoS Settings 
For each type of network traffic supported by your Axis network video product, enter a 
DSCP (Differentiated Services Codepoint) value. This value is used to mark the traffic’s IP 
header. When the marked traffic reaches a network router or switch, the DSCP value in the 
IP header tells the router or switch which type of treatment to apply to this type of traffic, 
for example, how much bandwidth to reserve for it. 
Note that DSCP values can be entered in decimal or hex form, but saved values are always 
shown in decimal.
For more information on Quality of Service, please see the Axis support web at 
www.axis.com/techsup
SMTP (email)
Enter the host names (or IP addresses) and port numbers for your primary and secondary 
mail servers in the fields provided, to enable the sending of notifications and image/video 
email messages from the camera to predefined addresses via SMTP.
If your mail server requires authentication, check the box for Use authentication to log in 
to this server and enter the necessary information.
SNMP
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) allows remote management of network 
devices. Depending on the level of security required, select the version of SNMP to use. The 
three levels of security are:
• SNMP V1 - includes no security.
• SNMP V2c - uses very simple security. The community name can be specified as a pass-
word for read or read/write access to all supported SNMP objects. The community is the 
the group of network devices using SNMP.
• SNMP V3 - provides encryption and secure passwords. HTTPS must be enabled. AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - System Options  39 
UPnP™
The camera includes support for UPnP™, which is enabled by default. If also enabled on 
your computer, the camera will automatically be detected and a new icon will be added to 
“My Network Places.” 
Note: UPnP must also be enabled on your Windows XP. To do this, open the Control Panel from the Start Menu 
and select Add/Remove Programs. Select Add/Remove Windows Components and open the Networking 
Services section. Click Details and then select UPnP as the service to add.
RTP
These settings are the port range, IP address, port number (video and audio), and 
Time-To-Live value to use for the video stream(s) in multicast MPEG-4 format. Only 
certain IP addresses and port numbers should be used for multicast streams. For more 
information, please see the online help.
Bonjour
The AXIS 207MW includes support for Bonjour. When enabled, the camera is 
automatically detected by operating systems and clients that support this protocol. 
Ports & Devices
I/O Ports - the pinout, interface support and the control and monitoring functions 
provided by this connector are described in The I/O Terminal Connector, on page 42.
LED Settings
The Status indicator LED on the front of the camera can be set to flash at a configurable 
interval (or to not light up at all) whenever the unit is accessed. For a listing of all LED 
behavior, see page 7, or the online help.
Note: The LED does not flash when the stream is retrieved using MPEG-4 multicast.

Troubleshooting
Checking the Firmware
Firmware is software that determines the functionality of the AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW. 
One of your first actions when troubleshooting a problem should be to check the currently 
installed firmware version. An updated version may contain a correction that fixes your 
particular problem. The current firmware version in your camera can be seen on the page 
Setup > Basic Configuration.
Upgrading the Firmware
When you upgrade the firmware with a file from the Axis Web site, your camera will 
receive the latest available functionality. Always read the upgrade instructions and release 
notes available with each new release, before updating the firmware.
Note:  Preconfigured and customized settings will be saved when the firmware is upgraded (providing the fea-
tures are available in the new firmware) although this is not guaranteed by Axis Communications. Always 
read the instructions and release notes available with each new release, before upgrading the firmware.
1. Save the firmware file to your computer. The latest version of the firmware is 
available free of charge from the Axis Web site at www.axis.com/techsup
2. Go to Setup > System Options > Maintenance in the camera’s Web pages.
3. In the Upgrade Server section, browse to the desired firmware file on your computer. 
Click Upgrade.
Notes:  •After starting the upgrade process, always wait at least 10-15 minutes before restarting the

user. AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - Troubleshooting  45 
Emergency Recovery Procedure
If power or the network connection to the camera is lost during the upgrade, the process 
will fail and the unit will become unresponsive. A flashing red Status LED indicates a failed 
upgrade. To recover the unit, follow the steps below. The serial number is found on the 
label attached to the bottom of the camera.
1. This procedure is only possible to perform via the wired connection - connect the 
camera to the network via a standard network cable.
2. Unix/Linux - From the command line, type the following: 
arp -s <IP address of camera> <Serial number> temp 
ping -s 408 <IP address of camera> 
 
Windows - From a command/DOS prompt, type the following: 
arp -s <IP address of camera> <Serial number> 
ping -l 408 -t <IP address of camera>
3. If the unit does not reply within a few seconds, restart it and wait for a reply. Press 
CTRL+C to stop Ping.
4. Open a browser and type in the camera’s IP address. In the page that appears, use the 
Browse button to select the upgrade file to use, e.g. axis207mw.bin. Then click the 
Load button to restart the upgrade process. 
5. After the upgrade has completed (1-10 minutes), the unit will automatically restart and 
show a steady green on the Power and Status LEDs and flashing green or amber on the

another device window, type ping and the IP address of the unit). 
If you receive: Reply from <IP address>: bytes = 32; time = 10 ms..... - this means that 
the IP address may already be in use by another device on your network. You must obtain a 
new IP address and reinstall the unit. 
If you see: Request timed out - this means that the IP address is available for use with 
your camera. In this case, check all cabling and reinstall the unit.
Possible IP address conflict with  The static IP address in the camera is used before the DHCP server sets a a dynamic

device, there may be problems accessing the camera. To avoid this, set the static IP address 
to 0.0.0.0. 
The camera cannot be accessed from a browser
The IP address has been changed by  1) Move the camera to an isolated network or to one with no DHCP or BOOTP server. Set 
DHCP the IP address again, using the AXIS IP Utility (see the Installation Guide) or the ARP/Ping 
commands. 
2) Access the unit and disable DHCP in the TCP/IP settings. Return the unit to the main 
network. The unit now has a fixed IP address that will not change. 
3) As an alternative to 2), if dynamic IP address via DHCP or BOOTP is required, select the 
required service and then configure IP address change notification from the network set-
tings. Return the unit to the main network. The unit will now have a dynamic IP address, 
but will notify you if the address changes.

General performance considerations
When setting up your system, it is important to consider how various settings and 
situations will affect performance. Some factors affect the amount of bandwidth (the bit 
rate) required, others can affect the frame rate, and some will affect both. If the load on the 
CPU reaches its maximum, this will also affect the frame rate.
The following factors are among the most important to consider:
• Wireless conditions.
• High image resolutions and/or lower compression levels result in larger images. 
Bandwidth affected. 
• Access by large numbers of Motion JPEG and/or unicast MPEG-4 clients. Band-
width affected.
• Simultaneous viewing of different streams (resolution, compression, etc.) by dif-
ferent clients. Frame rate and bandwidth affected.
• Accessing both Motion JPEG and MPEG-4 video streams simultaneously. Frame 
rate and bandwidth affected.
• Heavy usage of event settings affects the camera’s CPU load. Frame rate affected.
• Enabled motion detection. Frame rate and bandwidth affected.
• Heavy network utilization due to poor infrastructure. Bandwidth affected
• Viewing on poorly performing client PC’s lowers perceived performance. Frame 
rate affected.
There are also factors in the monitored scene that will affect the bandwidth. These are: 
• the amount of motion
• the image’s complexity
• the lighting conditions.
If supported on the network, consider also using MPEG-4 multicasting, as the bandwidth 
consumption will be much lower.
Optimizing your system
The AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW provides a tool that can be used to display the bandwidth 
and frame rate currently required by the video stream, directly in the video image.
To do this, special format strings are added as part 
of a text overlay. Simply add #r (average frame 
rate in fps) and/or #b (average bandwidth in kbps) 
to the overlay. 
For detailed instructions, please see the online help 
for Video & Image > Overlay Settings, and the 
help for File Naming & Date/Time Formats.  54  AXIS 207W/AXIS 207MW - Technical Specifications
Important!
•The figures displayed here are the values as delivered by the camera. If other restrictions are 
currently in force, (e.g. bandwidth limitation) these values might not correspond to those actu-
ally received by the client.
•For Motion JPEG, these values will be accurate as long as no frame rate limit has been specified.
Frame rates - Motion JPEG and MPEG-4
The following table show typical frame rates in frames/second (fps) for Motion JPEG and 
MPEG-4 video streams.
Motion JPEG settings:
• Viewing in AMC
• Compression level = 30%
MPEG-4 settings:
• Viewing in AMC
• Compression level = 30%
• GOV length = 30
